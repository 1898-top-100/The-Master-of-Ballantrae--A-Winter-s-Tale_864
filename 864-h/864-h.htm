<h1>The Master of Ballantrae<br />
A Winter&rsquo;s Tale</h1>
<h2>To Sir Percy Florence and Lady Shelley</h2>
<p>Here is a tale which extends over many years and travels into
many countries.&nbsp; By a peculiar fitness of circumstance the
writer began, continued it, and concluded it among distant and
diverse scenes.&nbsp; Above all, he was much upon the sea.&nbsp;
The character and fortune of the fraternal enemies, the hall and
shrubbery of Durrisdeer, the problem of Mackellar&rsquo;s
homespun and how to shape it for superior flights; these were his
company on deck in many star-reflecting harbours, ran often in
his mind at sea to the tune of slatting canvas, and were
dismissed (something of the suddenest) on the approach of
squalls.&nbsp; It is my hope that these surroundings of its
manufacture may to some degree find favour for my story with
seafarers and sea-lovers like yourselves.</p>
<p>And at least here is a dedication from a great way off:
written by the loud shores of a subtropical island near upon ten
thousand miles from Boscombe Chine and Manor: scenes which rise
before me as I write, along with the faces and voices of my
friends.</p>
<p>Well, I am for the sea once more; no doubt Sir Percy
also.&nbsp; Let us make the signal B. R. D.!</p>

<h2>PREFACE</h2>
<p>Although an old, consistent exile, the editor of the following
pages revisits now and again the city of which he exults to be a
native; and there are few things more strange, more painful, or
more salutary, than such revisitations.&nbsp; Outside, in foreign
spots, he comes by surprise and awakens more attention than he
had expected; in his own city, the relation is reversed, and he
stands amazed to be so little recollected.&nbsp; Elsewhere he is
refreshed to see attractive faces, to remark possible friends;
there he scouts the long streets, with a pang at heart, for the
faces and friends that are no more.&nbsp; Elsewhere he is
delighted with the presence of what is new, there tormented by
the absence of what is old.&nbsp; Elsewhere he is content to be
his present self; there he is smitten with an equal regret for
what he once was and for what he once hoped to be.</p>
<p>He was feeling all this dimly, as he drove from the station,
on his last visit; he was feeling it still as he alighted at the
door of his friend Mr. Johnstone Thomson, W.S., with whom he was
to stay.&nbsp; A hearty welcome, a face not altogether changed, a
few words that sounded of old days, a laugh provoked and shared,
a glimpse in passing of the snowy cloth and bright decanters and
the Piranesis on the dining-room wall, brought him to his
bed-room with a somewhat lightened cheer, and when he and Mr.
Thomson sat down a few minutes later, cheek by jowl, and pledged
the past in a preliminary bumper, he was already almost consoled,
he had already almost forgiven himself his two unpardonable
errors, that he should ever have left his native city, or ever
returned to it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have something quite in your way,&rdquo; said Mr.
Thomson.&nbsp; &ldquo;I wished to do honour to your arrival;
because, my dear fellow, it is my own youth that comes back along
with you; in a very tattered and withered state, to be sure,
but&mdash;well!&mdash;all that&rsquo;s left of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A great deal better than nothing,&rdquo; said the
editor.&nbsp; &ldquo;But what is this which is quite in my
way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was coming to that,&rdquo; said Mr. Thomson:
&ldquo;Fate has put it in my power to honour your arrival with
something really original by way of dessert.&nbsp; A
mystery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A mystery?&rdquo; I repeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said his friend, &ldquo;a mystery.&nbsp; It
may prove to be nothing, and it may prove to be a great
deal.&nbsp; But in the meanwhile it is truly mysterious, no eye
having looked on it for near a hundred years; it is highly
genteel, for it treats of a titled family; and it ought to be
melodramatic, for (according to the superscription) it is
concerned with death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I rarely heard a more obscure or a more
promising annunciation,&rdquo; the other remarked.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But what is It?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You remember my predecessor&rsquo;s, old Peter
M&rsquo;Brair&rsquo;s business?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember him acutely; he could not look at me without
a pang of reprobation, and he could not feel the pang without
betraying it.&nbsp; He was to me a man of a great historical
interest, but the interest was not returned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah well, we go beyond him,&rdquo; said Mr.
Thomson.&nbsp; &ldquo;I daresay old Peter knew as little about
this as I do.&nbsp; You see, I succeeded to a prodigious
accumulation of old law-papers and old tin boxes, some of them of
Peter&rsquo;s hoarding, some of his father&rsquo;s, John, first
of the dynasty, a great man in his day.&nbsp; Among other
collections, were all the papers of the Durrisdeers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Durrisdeers!&rdquo; cried I.&nbsp; &ldquo;My dear
fellow, these may be of the greatest interest.&nbsp; One of them
was out in the &rsquo;45; one had some strange passages with the
devil&mdash;you will find a note of it in Law&rsquo;s
<i>Memorials</i>, I think; and there was an unexplained tragedy,
I know not what, much later, about a hundred years
ago&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More than a hundred years ago,&rdquo; said Mr.
Thomson.&nbsp; &ldquo;In 1783.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know that?&nbsp; I mean some
death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, the lamentable deaths of my Lord Durrisdeer and
his brother, the Master of Ballantrae (attainted in the
troubles),&rdquo; said Mr. Thomson with something the tone of a
man quoting.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is that it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To say truth,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I have only seen
some dim reference to the things in memoirs; and heard some
traditions dimmer still, through my uncle (whom I think you
knew).&nbsp; My uncle lived when he was a boy in the
neighbourhood of St. Bride&rsquo;s; he has often told me of the
avenue closed up and grown over with grass, the great gates never
opened, the last lord and his old maid sister who lived in the
back parts of the house, a quiet, plain, poor, hum-drum couple it
would seem&mdash;but pathetic too, as the last of that stirring
and brave house&mdash;and, to the country folk, faintly terrible
from some deformed traditions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mr. Thomson.&nbsp; &ldquo;Henry Graeme
Durie, the last lord, died in 1820; his sister, the honourable
Miss Katherine Durie, in &rsquo;27; so much I know; and by what I
have been going over the last few days, they were what you say,
decent, quiet people and not rich.&nbsp; To say truth, it was a
letter of my lord&rsquo;s that put me on the search for the
packet we are going to open this evening.&nbsp; Some papers could
not be found; and he wrote to Jack M&rsquo;Brair suggesting they
might be among those sealed up by a Mr. Mackellar.&nbsp;
M&rsquo;Brair answered, that the papers in question were all in
Mackellar&rsquo;s own hand, all (as the writer understood) of a
purely narrative character; and besides, said he, &lsquo;I am
bound not to open them before the year 1889.&rsquo;&nbsp; You may
fancy if these words struck me: I instituted a hunt through all
the M&rsquo;Brair repositories; and at last hit upon that packet
which (if you have had enough wine) I propose to show you at
once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the smoking-room, to which my host now led me, was a
packet, fastened with many seals and enclosed in a single sheet
of strong paper thus endorsed:</p>
<blockquote><p>Papers relating to the lives and lamentable deaths
of the late Lord Durisdeer, and his elder brother James, commonly
called Master of Ballantrae, attainted in the troubles: entrusted
into the hands of John M&rsquo;Brair in the Lawnmarket of
Edinburgh, W.S.; this 20th day of September Anno Domini 1789; by
him to be kept secret until the revolution of one hundred years
complete, or until the 20th day of September 1889: the same
compiled and written by me, <span class="smcap">Ephraim
Mackellar</span>,</p>
<p>For near forty years Land Steward on the estates of his
Lordship.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As Mr. Thomson is a married man, I will not say what hour had
struck when we laid down the last of the following pages; but I
will give a few words of what ensued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; said Mr. Thomson, &ldquo;is a novel ready
to your hand: all you have to do is to work up the scenery,
develop the characters, and improve the style.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear fellow,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;they are just the
three things that I would rather die than set my hand to.&nbsp;
It shall be published as it stands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s so bald,&rdquo; objected Mr.
Thomson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe there is nothing so noble as baldness,&rdquo;
replied I, &ldquo;and I am sure there in nothing so
interesting.&nbsp; I would have all literature bald, and all
authors (if you like) but one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; add Mr. Thomson, &ldquo;we shall
see.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER I.&mdash;SUMMARY OF EVENTS DURING THIS MASTER&rsquo;S
WANDERINGS.</h2>
<p>The full truth of this odd matter is what the world has long
been looking for, and public curiosity is sure to welcome.&nbsp;
It so befell that I was intimately mingled with the last years
and history of the house; and there does not live one man so able
as myself to make these matters plain, or so desirous to narrate
them faithfully.&nbsp; I knew the Master; on many secret steps of
his career I have an authentic memoir in my hand; I sailed with
him on his last voyage almost alone; I made one upon that
winter&rsquo;s journey of which so many tales have gone abroad;
and I was there at the man&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; As for my late
Lord Durrisdeer, I served him and loved him near twenty years;
and thought more of him the more I knew of him.&nbsp; Altogether,
I think it not fit that so much evidence should perish; the truth
is a debt I owe my lord&rsquo;s memory; and I think my old years
will flow more smoothly, and my white hair lie quieter on the
pillow, when the debt is paid.</p>
<p>The Duries of Durrisdeer and Ballantrae were a strong family
in the south-west from the days of David First.&nbsp; A rhyme
still current in the countryside&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Kittle folk are the Durrisdeers,<br />
They ride wi&rsquo; over mony spears&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>bears the mark of its antiquity; and the name appears in
another, which common report attributes to Thomas of Ercildoune
himself&mdash;I cannot say how truly, and which some have
applied&mdash;I dare not say with how much justice&mdash;to the
events of this narration:</p>
<blockquote><p>Twa Duries in Durrisdeer,<br />
Ane to tie and ane to ride,<br />
An ill day for the groom<br />
And a waur day for the bride.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Authentic history besides is filled with their exploits which
(to our modern eyes) seem not very commendable: and the family
suffered its full share of those ups and downs to which the great
houses of Scotland have been ever liable.&nbsp; But all these I
pass over, to come to that memorable year 1745, when the
foundations of this tragedy were laid.</p>
<p>At that time there dwelt a family of four persons in the house
of Durrisdeer, near St. Bride&rsquo;s, on the Solway shore; a
chief hold of their race since the Reformation.&nbsp; My old
lord, eighth of the name, was not old in years, but he suffered
prematurely from the disabilities of age; his place was at the
chimney side; there he sat reading, in a lined gown, with few
words for any man, and wry words for none: the model of an old
retired housekeeper; and yet his mind very well nourished with
study, and reputed in the country to be more cunning than he
seemed.&nbsp; The master of Ballantrae, James in baptism, took
from his father the love of serious reading; some of his tact
perhaps as well, but that which was only policy in the father
became black dissimulation in the son.&nbsp; The face of his
behaviour was merely popular and wild: he sat late at wine, later
at the cards; had the name in the country of &ldquo;an unco man
for the lasses;&rdquo; and was ever in the front of broils.&nbsp;
But for all he was the first to go in, yet it was observed he was
invariably the best to come off; and his partners in mischief
were usually alone to pay the piper.&nbsp; This luck or dexterity
got him several ill-wishers, but with the rest of the country,
enhanced his reputation; so that great things were looked for in
his future, when he should have gained more gravity.&nbsp; One
very black mark he had to his name; but the matter was hushed up
at the time, and so defaced by legends before I came into those
parts, that I scruple to set it down.&nbsp; If it was true, it
was a horrid fact in one so young; and if false, it was a horrid
calumny.&nbsp; I think it notable that he had always vaunted
himself quite implacable, and was taken at his word; so that he
had the addition among his neighbours of &ldquo;an ill man to
cross.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here was altogether a young nobleman (not yet
twenty-four in the year &rsquo;45) who had made a figure in the
country beyond his time of life.&nbsp; The less marvel if there
were little heard of the second son, Mr. Henry (my late Lord
Durrisdeer), who was neither very bad nor yet very able, but an
honest, solid sort of lad like many of his neighbours.&nbsp;
Little heard, I say; but indeed it was a case of little
spoken.&nbsp; He was known among the salmon fishers in the firth,
for that was a sport that he assiduously followed; he was an
excellent good horse-doctor besides; and took a chief hand,
almost from a boy, in the management of the estates.&nbsp; How
hard a part that was, in the situation of that family, none knows
better than myself; nor yet with how little colour of justice a
man may there acquire the reputation of a tyrant and a
miser.&nbsp; The fourth person in the house was Miss Alison
Graeme, a near kinswoman, an orphan, and the heir to a
considerable fortune which her father had acquired in
trade.&nbsp; This money was loudly called for by my lord&rsquo;s
necessities; indeed the land was deeply mortgaged; and Miss
Alison was designed accordingly to be the Master&rsquo;s wife,
gladly enough on her side; with how much good-will on his, is
another matter.&nbsp; She was a comely girl, and in those days
very spirited and self-willed; for the old lord having no
daughter of his own, and my lady being long dead, she had grown
up as best she might.</p>
<p>To these four came the news of Prince Charlie&rsquo;s landing,
and set them presently by the ears.&nbsp; My lord, like the
chimney-keeper that he was, was all for temporising.&nbsp; Miss
Alison held the other side, because it appeared romantical; and
the Master (though I have heard they did not agree often) was for
this once of her opinion.&nbsp; The adventure tempted him, as I
conceive; he was tempted by the opportunity to raise the fortunes
of the house, and not less by the hope of paying off his private
liabilities, which were heavy beyond all opinion.&nbsp; As for
Mr. Henry, it appears he said little enough at first; his part
came later on.&nbsp; It took the three a whole day&rsquo;s
disputation, before they agreed to steer a middle course, one son
going forth to strike a blow for King James, my lord and the
other staying at home to keep in favour with King George.&nbsp;
Doubtless this was my lord&rsquo;s decision; and, as is well
known, it was the part played by many considerable
families.&nbsp; But the one dispute settled, another
opened.&nbsp; For my lord, Miss Alison, and Mr. Henry all held
the one view: that it was the cadet&rsquo;s part to go out; and
the Master, what with restlessness and vanity, would at no rate
consent to stay at home.&nbsp; My lord pleaded, Miss Alison wept,
Mr. Henry was very plain spoken: all was of no avail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the direct heir of Durrisdeer that should ride by
his King&rsquo;s bridle,&rdquo; says the Master.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we were playing a manly part,&rdquo; says Mr. Henry,
&ldquo;there might be sense in such talk.&nbsp; But what are we
doing?&nbsp; Cheating at cards!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are saving the house of Durrisdeer, Henry,&rdquo;
his father said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And see, James,&rdquo; said Mr. Henry, &ldquo;if I go,
and the Prince has the upper hand, it will be easy to make your
peace with King James.&nbsp; But if you go, and the expedition
fails, we divide the right and the title.&nbsp; And what shall I
be then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will be Lord Durrisdeer,&rdquo; said the
Master.&nbsp; &ldquo;I put all I have upon the table.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I play at no such game,&rdquo; cries Mr. Henry.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I shall be left in such a situation as no man of sense and
honour could endure.&nbsp; I shall be neither fish nor
flesh!&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp; And a little after he had another
expression, plainer perhaps than he intended.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is
your duty to be here with my father,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You know well enough you are the favourite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay?&rdquo; said the Master.&nbsp; &ldquo;And there
spoke Envy!&nbsp; Would you trip up my heels&mdash;Jacob?&rdquo;
said he, and dwelled upon the name maliciously.</p>
<p>Mr. Henry went and walked at the low end of the hall without
reply; for he had an excellent gift of silence.&nbsp; Presently
he came back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am the cadet and I <i>should</i> go,&rdquo; said
he.&nbsp; &ldquo;And my lord here in the master, and he says I
<i>shall</i> go.&nbsp; What say ye to that, my
brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say this, Harry,&rdquo; returned the Master,
&ldquo;that when very obstinate folk are met, there are only two
ways out: Blows&mdash;and I think none of us could care to go so
far; or the arbitrament of chance&mdash;and here is a guinea
piece.&nbsp; Will you stand by the toss of the coin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will stand and fall by it,&rdquo; said Mr.
Henry.&nbsp; &ldquo;Heads, I go; shield, I stay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The coin was spun, and it fell shield.&nbsp; &ldquo;So there
is a lesson for Jacob,&rdquo; says the Master.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall live to repent of this,&rdquo; says Mr. Henry,
and flung out of the hall.</p>
<p>As for Miss Alison, she caught up that piece of gold which had
just sent her lover to the wars, and flung it clean through the
family shield in the great painted window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you loved me as well as I love you, you would have
stayed,&rdquo; cried she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I could not love you, dear, so well, loved I not
honour more,&rsquo;&rdquo; sang the Master.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;you have no heart&mdash;I
hope you may be killed!&rdquo; and she ran from the room, and in
tears, to her own chamber.</p>
<p>It seems the Master turned to my lord with his most comical
manner, and says he, &ldquo;This looks like a devil of a
wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you are a devil of a son to me,&rdquo; cried
his father, &ldquo;you that have always been the favourite, to my
shame be it spoken.&nbsp; Never a good hour have I gotten of you,
since you were born; no, never one good hour,&rdquo; and repeated
it again the third time.&nbsp; Whether it was the Master&rsquo;s
levity, or his insubordination, or Mr. Henry&rsquo;s word about
the favourite son, that had so much disturbed my lord, I do not
know; but I incline to think it was the last, for I have it by
all accounts that Mr. Henry was more made up to from that
hour.</p>
<p>Altogether it was in pretty ill blood with his family that the
Master rode to the North; which was the more sorrowful for others
to remember when it seemed too late.&nbsp; By fear and favour he
had scraped together near upon a dozen men, principally
tenants&rsquo; sons; they were all pretty full when they set
forth, and rode up the hill by the old abbey, roaring and
singing, the white cockade in every hat.&nbsp; It was a desperate
venture for so small a company to cross the most of Scotland
unsupported; and (what made folk think so the more) even as that
poor dozen was clattering up the hill, a great ship of the
king&rsquo;s navy, that could have brought them under with a
single boat, lay with her broad ensign streaming in the
bay.&nbsp; The next afternoon, having given the Master a fair
start, it was Mr. Henry&rsquo;s turn; and he rode off, all by
himself, to offer his sword and carry letters from his father to
King George&rsquo;s Government.&nbsp; Miss Alison was shut in her
room, and did little but weep, till both were gone; only she
stitched the cockade upon the Master&rsquo;s hat, and (as John
Paul told me) it was wetted with tears when he carried it down to
him.</p>
<p>In all that followed, Mr. Henry and my old lord were true to
their bargain.&nbsp; That ever they accomplished anything is more
than I could learn; and that they were anyway strong on the
king&rsquo;s side, more than believe.&nbsp; But they kept the
letter of loyalty, corresponded with my Lord President, sat still
at home, and had little or no commerce with the Master while that
business lasted.&nbsp; Nor was he, on his side, more
communicative.&nbsp; Miss Alison, indeed, was always sending him
expresses, but I do not know if she had many answers.&nbsp;
Macconochie rode for her once, and found the highlanders before
Carlisle, and the Master riding by the Prince&rsquo;s side in
high favour; he took the letter (so Macconochie tells), opened
it, glanced it through with a mouth like a man whistling, and
stuck it in his belt, whence, on his horse passageing, it fell
unregarded to the ground.&nbsp; It was Macconochie who picked it
up; and he still kept it, and indeed I have seen it in his
hands.&nbsp; News came to Durrisdeer of course, by the common
report, as it goes travelling through a country, a thing always
wonderful to me.&nbsp; By that means the family learned more of
the Master&rsquo;s favour with the Prince, and the ground it was
said to stand on: for by a strange condescension in a man so
proud&mdash;only that he was a man still more ambitious&mdash;he
was said to have crept into notability by truckling to the
Irish.&nbsp; Sir Thomas Sullivan, Colonel Burke and the rest,
were his daily comrades, by which course he withdrew himself from
his own country-folk.&nbsp; All the small intrigues he had a hand
in fomenting; thwarted my Lord George upon a thousand points; was
always for the advice that seemed palatable to the Prince, no
matter if it was good or bad; and seems upon the whole (like the
gambler he was all through life) to have had less regard to the
chances of the campaign than to the greatness of favour he might
aspire to, if, by any luck, it should succeed.&nbsp; For the
rest, he did very well in the field; no one questioned that; for
he was no coward.</p>
<p>The next was the news of Culloden, which was brought to
Durrisdeer by one of the tenants&rsquo; sons&mdash;the only
survivor, he declared, of all those that had gone singing up the
hill.&nbsp; By an unfortunate chance John Paul and Macconochie
had that very morning found the guinea piece&mdash;which was the
root of all the evil&mdash;sticking in a holly bush; they had
been &ldquo;up the gait,&rdquo; as the servants say at
Durrisdeer, to the change-house; and if they had little left of
the guinea, they had less of their wits.&nbsp; What must John
Paul do but burst into the hall where the family sat at dinner,
and cry the news to them that &ldquo;Tam Macmorland was but new
lichtit at the door, and&mdash;wirra, wirra&mdash;there were nane
to come behind him&rdquo;?</p>
<p>They took the word in silence like folk condemned; only Mr.
Henry carrying his palm to his face, and Miss Alison laying her
head outright upon her hands.&nbsp; As for my lord, he was like
ashes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have still one son,&rdquo; says he.&nbsp; &ldquo;And,
Henry, I will do you this justice&mdash;it is the kinder that is
left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a strange thing to say in such a moment; but my lord
had never forgotten Mr. Henry&rsquo;s speech, and he had years of
injustice on his conscience.&nbsp; Still it was a strange thing,
and more than Miss Alison could let pass.&nbsp; She broke out and
blamed my lord for his unnatural words, and Mr. Henry because he
was sitting there in safety when his brother lay dead, and
herself because she had given her sweetheart ill words at his
departure, calling him the flower of the flock, wringing her
hands, protesting her love, and crying on him by his
name&mdash;so that the servants stood astonished.</p>
<p>Mr. Henry got to his feet, and stood holding his chair.&nbsp;
It was he that was like ashes now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; he burst out suddenly, &ldquo;I know you
loved him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The world knows that, glory be to God!&rdquo; cries
she; and then to Mr. Henry: &ldquo;There is none but me to know
one thing&mdash;that you were a traitor to him in your
heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God knows,&rdquo; groans he, &ldquo;it was lost love on
both sides.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Time went by in the house after that without much change; only
they were now three instead of four, which was a perpetual
reminder of their loss.&nbsp; Miss Alison&rsquo;s money, you are
to bear in mind, wag highly needful for the estates; and the one
brother being dead, my old lord soon set his heart upon her
marrying the other.&nbsp; Day in, day out, he would work upon
her, sitting by the chimney-side with his finger in his Latin
book, and his eyes set upon her face with a kind of pleasant
intentness that became the old gentleman very well.&nbsp; If she
wept, he would condole with her like an ancient man that has seen
worse times and begins to think lightly even of sorrow; if she
raged, he would fall to reading again in his Latin book, but
always with some civil excuse; if she offered, as she often did,
to let them have her money in a gift, he would show her how
little it consisted with his honour, and remind her, even if he
should consent, that Mr. Henry would certainly refuse.&nbsp;
<i>Non vi sed saepe cadendo</i> was a favourite word of his; and
no doubt this quiet persecution wore away much of her resolve; no
doubt, besides, he had a great influence on the girl, having
stood in the place of both her parents; and, for that matter, she
was herself filled with the spirit of the Duries, and would have
gone a great way for the glory of Durrisdeer; but not so far, I
think, as to marry my poor patron, had it not
been&mdash;strangely enough&mdash;for the circumstance of his
extreme unpopularity.</p>
<p>This was the work of Tam Macmorland.&nbsp; There was not much
harm in Tam; but he had that grievous weakness, a long tongue;
and as the only man in that country who had been out&mdash;or,
rather, who had come in again&mdash;he was sure of
listeners.&nbsp; Those that have the underhand in any fighting, I
have observed, are ever anxious to persuade themselves they were
betrayed.&nbsp; By Tam&rsquo;s account of it, the rebels had been
betrayed at every turn and by every officer they had; they had
been betrayed at Derby, and betrayed at Falkirk; the night march
was a step of treachery of my Lord George&rsquo;s; and Culloden
was lost by the treachery of the Macdonalds.&nbsp; This habit of
imputing treason grew upon the fool, till at last he must have in
Mr. Henry also.&nbsp; Mr. Henry (by his account) had betrayed the
lads of Durrisdeer; he had promised to follow with more men, and
instead of that he had ridden to King George.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ay,
and the next day!&rdquo; Tam would cry.&nbsp; &ldquo;The puir
bonnie Master, and the puir, kind lads that rade wi&rsquo; him,
were hardly ower the scaur, or he was aff&mdash;the Judis!&nbsp;
Ay, weel&mdash;he has his way o&rsquo;t: he&rsquo;s to be my
lord, nae less, and there&rsquo;s mony a cold corp amang the
Hieland heather!&rdquo;&nbsp; And at this, if Tam had been
drinking, he would begin to weep.</p>
<p>Let anyone speak long enough, he will get believers.&nbsp;
This view of Mr. Henry&rsquo;s behaviour crept about the country
by little and little; it was talked upon by folk that knew the
contrary, but were short of topics; and it was heard and believed
and given out for gospel by the ignorant and the
ill-willing.&nbsp; Mr. Henry began to be shunned; yet awhile, and
the commons began to murmur as he went by, and the women (who are
always the most bold because they are the most safe) to cry out
their reproaches to his face.&nbsp; The Master was cried up for a
saint.&nbsp; It was remembered how he had never any hand in
pressing the tenants; as, indeed, no more he had, except to spend
the money.&nbsp; He was a little wild perhaps, the folk said; but
how much better was a natural, wild lad that would soon have
settled down, than a skinflint and a sneckdraw, sitting, with his
nose in an account book, to persecute poor tenants!&nbsp; One
trollop, who had had a child to the Master, and by all accounts
been very badly used, yet made herself a kind of champion of his
memory.&nbsp; She flung a stone one day at Mr. Henry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whaur&rsquo;s the bonnie lad that trustit ye?&rdquo;
she cried.</p>
<p>Mr. Henry reined in his horse and looked upon her, the blood
flowing from his lip.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ay, Jess?&rdquo; says
he.&nbsp; &ldquo;You too?&nbsp; And yet ye should ken me
better.&rdquo;&nbsp; For it was he who had helped her with
money.</p>
<p>The woman had another stone ready, which she made as if she
would cast; and he, to ward himself, threw up the hand that held
his riding-rod.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, would ye beat a lassie, ye ugly&mdash;?&rdquo;
cries she, and ran away screaming as though he had struck
her.</p>
<p>Next day word went about the country like wildfire that Mr.
Henry had beaten Jessie Broun within an inch of her life.&nbsp; I
give it as one instance of how this snowball grew, and one
calumny brought another; until my poor patron was so perished in
reputation that he began to keep the house like my lord.&nbsp;
All this while, you may be very sure, he uttered no complaints at
home; the very ground of the scandal was too sore a matter to be
handled; and Mr. Henry was very proud and strangely obstinate in
silence.&nbsp; My old lord must have heard of it, by John Paul,
if by no one else; and he must at least have remarked the altered
habits of his son.&nbsp; Yet even he, it is probable, knew not
how high the feeling ran; and as for Miss Alison, she was ever
the last person to hear news, and the least interested when she
heard them.</p>
<p>In the height of the ill-feeling (for it died away as it came,
no man could say why) there was an election forward in the town
of St. Bride&rsquo;s, which is the next to Durrisdeer, standing
on the Water of Swift; some grievance was fermenting, I forget
what, if ever I heard; and it was currently said there would be
broken heads ere night, and that the sheriff had sent as far as
Dumfries for soldiers.&nbsp; My lord moved that Mr. Henry should
be present, assuring him it was necessary to appear, for the
credit of the house.&nbsp; &ldquo;It will soon be
reported,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that we do not take the lead in
our own country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a strange lead that I can take,&rdquo; said Mr.
Henry; and when they had pushed him further, &ldquo;I tell you
the plain truth,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I dare not show my
face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are the first of the house that ever said
so,&rdquo; cries Miss Alison.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will go all three,&rdquo; said my lord; and sure
enough he got into his boots (the first time in four
years&mdash;a sore business John Paul had to get them on), and
Miss Alison into her riding-coat, and all three rode together to
St. Bride&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>The streets were full of the rift-raff of all the countryside,
who had no sooner clapped eyes on Mr. Henry than the hissing
began, and the hooting, and the cries of &ldquo;Judas!&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Where was the Master?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Where were the
poor lads that rode with him?&rdquo;&nbsp; Even a stone was cast;
but the more part cried shame at that, for my old lord&rsquo;s
sake, and Miss Alison&rsquo;s.&nbsp; It took not ten minutes to
persuade my lord that Mr. Henry had been right.&nbsp; He said
never a word, but turned his horse about, and home again, with
his chin upon his bosom.&nbsp; Never a word said Miss Alison; no
doubt she thought the more; no doubt her pride was stung, for she
was a bone-bred Durie; and no doubt her heart was touched to see
her cousin so unjustly used.&nbsp; That night she was never in
bed; I have often blamed my lady&mdash;when I call to mind that
night, I readily forgive her all; and the first thing in the
morning she came to the old lord in his usual seat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Henry still wants me,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;he can
have me now.&rdquo;&nbsp; To himself she had a different speech:
&ldquo;I bring you no love, Henry; but God knows, all the pity in
the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>June the 1st, 1748, was the day of their marriage.&nbsp; It
was December of the same year that first saw me alighting at the
doors of the great house; and from there I take up the history of
events as they befell under my own observation, like a witness in
a court.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER II.&nbsp; SUMMARY OF EVENTS (<i>continued</i>)</h2>
<p>I made the last of my journey in the cold end of December, in
a mighty dry day of frost, and who should be my guide but Patey
Macmorland, brother of Tam!&nbsp; For a tow-headed, bare-legged
brat of ten, he had more ill tales upon his tongue than ever I
heard the match of; having drunken betimes in his brother&rsquo;s
cup.&nbsp; I was still not so old myself; pride had not yet the
upper hand of curiosity; and indeed it would have taken any man,
that cold morning, to hear all the old clashes of the country,
and be shown all the places by the way where strange things had
fallen out.&nbsp; I had tales of Claverhouse as we came through
the bogs, and tales of the devil, as we came over the top of the
scaur.&nbsp; As we came in by the abbey I heard somewhat of the
old monks, and more of the freetraders, who use its ruins for a
magazine, landing for that cause within a cannon-shot of
Durrisdeer; and along all the road the Duries and poor Mr. Henry
were in the first rank of slander.&nbsp; My mind was thus highly
prejudiced against the family I was about to serve, so that I was
half surprised when I beheld Durrisdeer itself, lying in a
pretty, sheltered bay, under the Abbey Hill; the house most
commodiously built in the French fashion, or perhaps Italianate,
for I have no skill in these arts; and the place the most
beautified with gardens, lawns, shrubberies, and trees I had ever
seen.&nbsp; The money sunk here unproductively would have quite
restored the family; but as it was, it cost a revenue to keep it
up.</p>
<p>Mr. Henry came himself to the door to welcome me: a tall dark
young gentleman (the Duries are all black men) of a plain and not
cheerful face, very strong in body, but not so strong in health:
taking me by the hand without any pride, and putting me at home
with plain kind speeches.&nbsp; He led me into the hall, booted
as I was, to present me to my lord.&nbsp; It was still daylight;
and the first thing I observed was a lozenge of clear glass in
the midst of the shield in the painted window, which I remember
thinking a blemish on a room otherwise so handsome, with its
family portraits, and the pargeted ceiling with pendants, and the
carved chimney, in one corner of which my old lord sat reading in
his Livy.&nbsp; He was like Mr. Henry, with much the same plain
countenance, only more subtle and pleasant, and his talk a
thousand times more entertaining.&nbsp; He had many questions to
ask me, I remember, of Edinburgh College, where I had just
received my mastership of arts, and of the various professors,
with whom and their proficiency he seemed well acquainted; and
thus, talking of things that I knew, I soon got liberty of speech
in my new home.</p>
<p>In the midst of this came Mrs. Henry into the room; she was
very far gone, Miss Katharine being due in about six weeks, which
made me think less of her beauty at the first sight; and she used
me with more of condescension than the rest; so that, upon all
accounts, I kept her in the third place of my esteem.</p>
<p>It did not take long before all Patey Macmorland&rsquo;s tales
were blotted out of my belief, and I was become, what I have ever
since remained, a loving servant of the house of
Durrisdeer.&nbsp; Mr. Henry had the chief part of my
affection.&nbsp; It was with him I worked; and I found him an
exacting master, keeping all his kindness for those hours in
which we were unemployed, and in the steward&rsquo;s office not
only loading me with work, but viewing me with a shrewd
supervision.&nbsp; At length one day he looked up from his paper
with a kind of timidness, and says he, &ldquo;Mr. Mackellar, I
think I ought to tell you that you do very well.&rdquo;&nbsp;
That was my first word of commendation; and from that day his
jealousy of my performance was relaxed; soon it was &ldquo;Mr.
Mackellar&rdquo; here, and &ldquo;Mr. Mackellar&rdquo; there,
with the whole family; and for much of my service at Durrisdeer,
I have transacted everything at my own time, and to my own fancy,
and never a farthing challenged.&nbsp; Even while he was driving
me, I had begun to find my heart go out to Mr. Henry; no doubt,
partly in pity, he was a man so palpably unhappy.&nbsp; He would
fall into a deep muse over our accounts, staring at the page or
out of the window; and at those times the look of his face, and
the sigh that would break from him, awoke in me strong feelings
of curiosity and commiseration.&nbsp; One day, I remember, we
were late upon some business in the steward&rsquo;s room.</p>
<p>This room is in the top of the house, and has a view upon the
bay, and over a little wooded cape, on the long sands; and there,
right over against the sun, which was then dipping, we saw the
freetraders, with a great force of men and horses, scouring on
the beach.&nbsp; Mr. Henry had been staring straight west, so
that I marvelled he was not blinded by the sun; suddenly he
frowns, rubs his hand upon his brow, and turns to me with a
smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would not guess what I was thinking,&rdquo; says
he.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was thinking I would be a happier man if I
could ride and run the danger of my life, with these lawless
companions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I told him I had observed he did not enjoy good spirits; and
that it was a common fancy to envy others and think we should be
the better of some change; quoting Horace to the point, like a
young man fresh from college.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, just so,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;And with
that we may get back to our accounts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was not long before I began to get wind of the causes that
so much depressed him.&nbsp; Indeed a blind man must have soon
discovered there was a shadow on that house, the shadow of the
Master of Ballantrae.&nbsp; Dead or alive (and he was then
supposed to be dead) that man was his brother&rsquo;s rival: his
rival abroad, where there was never a good word for Mr. Henry,
and nothing but regret and praise for the Master; and his rival
at home, not only with his father and his wife, but with the very
servants.</p>
<p>They were two old serving-men that were the leaders.&nbsp;
John Paul, a little, bald, solemn, stomachy man, a great
professor of piety and (take him for all in all) a pretty
faithful servant, was the chief of the Master&rsquo;s
faction.&nbsp; None durst go so far as John.&nbsp; He took a
pleasure in disregarding Mr. Henry publicly, often with a
slighting comparison.&nbsp; My lord and Mrs. Henry took him up,
to be sure, but never so resolutely as they should; and he had
only to pull his weeping face and begin his lamentations for the
Master&mdash;&ldquo;his laddie,&rdquo; as he called him&mdash;to
have the whole condoned.&nbsp; As for Henry, he let these things
pass in silence, sometimes with a sad and sometimes with a black
look.&nbsp; There was no rivalling the dead, he knew that; and
how to censure an old serving-man for a fault of loyalty, was
more than he could see.&nbsp; His was not the tongue to do
it.</p>
<p>Macconochie was chief upon the other side; an old, ill-spoken,
swearing, ranting, drunken dog; and I have often thought it an
odd circumstance in human nature that these two serving-men
should each have been the champion of his contrary, and blackened
their own faults and made light of their own virtues when they
beheld them in a master.&nbsp; Macconochie had soon smelled out
my secret inclination, took me much into his confidence, and
would rant against the Master by the hour, so that even my work
suffered.&nbsp; &ldquo;They&rsquo;re a&rsquo; daft here,&rdquo;
he would cry, &ldquo;and be damned to them!&nbsp; The
Master&mdash;the deil&rsquo;s in their thrapples that should call
him sae! it&rsquo;s Mr. Henry should be master now!&nbsp; They
were nane sae fond o&rsquo; the Master when they had him,
I&rsquo;ll can tell ye that.&nbsp; Sorrow on his name!&nbsp;
Never a guid word did I hear on his lips, nor naebody else, but
just fleering and flyting and profane cursing&mdash;deil hae
him!&nbsp; There&rsquo;s nane kent his wickedness: him a
gentleman!&nbsp; Did ever ye hear tell, Mr. Mackellar, o&rsquo;
Wully White the wabster?&nbsp; No?&nbsp; Aweel, Wully was an unco
praying kind o&rsquo; man; a dreigh body, nane o&rsquo; my kind,
I never could abide the sight o&rsquo; him; onyway he was a great
hand by his way of it, and he up and rebukit the Master for some
of his on-goings.&nbsp; It was a grand thing for the Master
o&rsquo; Ball&rsquo;ntrae to tak up a feud wi&rsquo; a&rsquo;
wabster, wasnae&rsquo;t?&rdquo;&nbsp; Macconochie would sneer;
indeed, he never took the full name upon his lips but with a sort
of a whine of hatred.&nbsp; &ldquo;But he did!&nbsp; A fine
employ it was: chapping at the man&rsquo;s door, and crying
&lsquo;boo&rsquo; in his lum, and puttin&rsquo; poother in his
fire, and pee-oys <a name="citation1"></a><a href="#footnote1"
class="citation">[1]</a> in his window; till the man thocht it
was auld Hornie was come seekin&rsquo; him.&nbsp; Weel, to mak a
lang story short, Wully gaed gyte.&nbsp; At the hinder end, they
couldnae get him frae his knees, but he just roared and prayed
and grat straucht on, till he got his release.&nbsp; It was fair
murder, a&rsquo;body said that.&nbsp; Ask John Paul&mdash;he was
brawly ashamed o&rsquo; that game, him that&rsquo;s sic a
Christian man!&nbsp; Grand doin&rsquo;s for the Master o&rsquo;
Ball&rsquo;ntrae!&rdquo;&nbsp; I asked him what the Master had
thought of it himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;How would I ken?&rdquo; says
he.&nbsp; &ldquo;He never said naething.&rdquo;&nbsp; And on
again in his usual manner of banning and swearing, with every now
and again a &ldquo;Master of Ballantrae&rdquo; sneered through
his nose.&nbsp; It was in one of these confidences that he showed
me the Carlisle letter, the print of the horse-shoe still stamped
in the paper.&nbsp; Indeed, that was our last confidence; for he
then expressed himself so ill-naturedly of Mrs. Henry that I had
to reprimand him sharply, and must thenceforth hold him at a
distance.</p>
<p>My old lord was uniformly kind to Mr. Henry; he had even
pretty ways of gratitude, and would sometimes clap him on the
shoulder and say, as if to the world at large: &ldquo;This is a
very good son to me.&rdquo;&nbsp; And grateful he was, no doubt,
being a man of sense and justice.&nbsp; But I think that was all,
and I am sure Mr. Henry thought so.&nbsp; The love was all for
the dead son.&nbsp; Not that this was often given breath to;
indeed, with me but once.&nbsp; My lord had asked me one day how
I got on with Mr. Henry, and I had told him the truth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said he, looking sideways on the burning
fire, &ldquo;Henry is a good lad, a very good lad,&rdquo; said
he.&nbsp; &ldquo;You have heard, Mr. Mackellar, that I had
another son?&nbsp; I am afraid he was not so virtuous a lad as
Mr. Henry; but dear me, he&rsquo;s dead, Mr. Mackellar! and while
he lived we were all very proud of him, all very proud.&nbsp; If
he was not all he should have been in some ways, well, perhaps we
loved him better!&rdquo;&nbsp; This last he said looking musingly
in the fire; and then to me, with a great deal of briskness,
&ldquo;But I am rejoiced you do so well with Mr. Henry.&nbsp; You
will find him a good master.&rdquo;&nbsp; And with that he opened
his book, which was the customary signal of dismission.&nbsp; But
it would be little that he read, and less that he understood;
Culloden field and the Master, these would be the burthen of his
thought; and the burthen of mine was an unnatural jealousy of the
dead man for Mr. Henry&rsquo;s sake, that had even then begun to
grow on me.</p>
<p>I am keeping Mrs. Henry for the last, so that this expression
of my sentiment may seem unwarrantably strong: the reader shall
judge for himself when I have done.&nbsp; But I must first tell
of another matter, which was the means of bringing me more
intimate.&nbsp; I had not yet been six months at Durrisdeer when
it chanced that John Paul fell sick and must keep his bed; drink
was the root of his malady, in my poor thought; but he was
tended, and indeed carried himself, like an afflicted saint; and
the very minister, who came to visit him, professed himself
edified when he went away.&nbsp; The third morning of his
sickness, Mr. Henry comes to me with something of a hang-dog
look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mackellar,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;I wish I could
trouble you upon a little service.&nbsp; There is a pension we
pay; it is John&rsquo;s part to carry it, and now that he is sick
I know not to whom I should look unless it was yourself.&nbsp;
The matter is very delicate; I could not carry it with my own
hand for a sufficient reason; I dare not send Macconochie, who is
a talker, and I am&mdash;I have&mdash;I am desirous this should
not come to Mrs. Henry&rsquo;s ears,&rdquo; says he, and flushed
to his neck as he said it.</p>
<p>To say truth, when I found I was to carry money to one Jessie
Broun, who was no better than she should be, I supposed it was
some trip of his own that Mr. Henry was dissembling.&nbsp; I was
the more impressed when the truth came out.</p>
<p>It was up a wynd off a side street in St. Bride&rsquo;s that
Jessie had her lodging.&nbsp; The place was very ill inhabited,
mostly by the freetrading sort.&nbsp; There was a man with a
broken head at the entry; half-way up, in a tavern, fellows were
roaring and singing, though it was not yet nine in the day.&nbsp;
Altogether, I had never seen a worse neighbourhood, even in the
great city of Edinburgh, and I was in two minds to go back.&nbsp;
Jessie&rsquo;s room was of a piece with her surroundings, and
herself no better.&nbsp; She would not give me the receipt (which
Mr. Henry had told me to demand, for he was very methodical)
until she had sent out for spirits, and I had pledged her in a
glass; and all the time she carried on in a light-headed,
reckless way&mdash;now aping the manners of a lady, now breaking
into unseemly mirth, now making coquettish advances that
oppressed me to the ground.&nbsp; Of the money she spoke more
tragically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s blood money!&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;I take
it for that: blood money for the betrayed!&nbsp; See what
I&rsquo;m brought down to!&nbsp; Ah, if the bonnie lad were back
again, it would be changed days.&nbsp; But he&rsquo;s
deid&mdash;he&rsquo;s lyin&rsquo; deid amang the Hieland
hills&mdash;the bonnie lad, the bonnie lad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had a rapt manner of crying on the bonnie lad, clasping
her hands and casting up her eyes, that I think she must have
learned of strolling players; and I thought her sorrow very much
of an affectation, and that she dwelled upon the business because
her shame was now all she had to be proud of.&nbsp; I will not
say I did not pity her, but it was a loathing pity at the best;
and her last change of manner wiped it out.&nbsp; This was when
she had had enough of me for an audience, and had set her name at
last to the receipt.&nbsp; &ldquo;There!&rdquo; says she, and
taking the most unwomanly oaths upon her tongue, bade me begone
and carry it to the Judas who had sent me.&nbsp; It was the first
time I had heard the name applied to Mr. Henry; I was staggered
besides at her sudden vehemence of word and manner, and got forth
from the room, under this shower of curses, like a beaten
dog.&nbsp; But even then I was not quit, for the vixen threw up
her window, and, leaning forth, continued to revile me as I went
up the wynd; the freetraders, coming to the tavern door, joined
in the mockery, and one had even the inhumanity to set upon me a
very savage small dog, which bit me in the ankle.&nbsp; This was
a strong lesson, had I required one, to avoid ill company; and I
rode home in much pain from the bite and considerable indignation
of mind.</p>
<p>Mr. Henry was in the steward&rsquo;s room, affecting
employment, but I could see he was only impatient to hear of my
errand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; says he, as soon as I came in; and when I
had told him something of what passed, and that Jessie seemed an
undeserving woman and far from grateful: &ldquo;She is no friend
to me,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;but, indeed, Mackellar, I have few
friends to boast of, and Jessie has some cause to be
unjust.&nbsp; I need not dissemble what all the country knows:
she was not very well used by one of our family.&rdquo;&nbsp;
This was the first time I had heard him refer to the Master even
distantly; and I think he found his tongue rebellious even for
that much, but presently he resumed&mdash;&ldquo;This is why I
would have nothing said.&nbsp; It would give pain to Mrs. Henry .
. . and to my father,&rdquo; he added, with another flush.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Henry,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;if you will take a
freedom at my hands, I would tell you to let that woman be.&nbsp;
What service is your money to the like of her?&nbsp; She has no
sobriety and no economy&mdash;as for gratitude, you will as soon
get milk from a whinstone; and if you will pretermit your bounty,
it will make no change at all but just to save the ankles of your
messengers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Henry smiled.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I am grieved about your
ankle,&rdquo; said he, the next moment, with a proper
gravity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And observe,&rdquo; I continued, &ldquo;I give you this
advice upon consideration; and yet my heart was touched for the
woman in the beginning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, there it is, you see!&rdquo; said Mr. Henry.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And you are to remember that I knew her once a very decent
lass.&nbsp; Besides which, although I speak little of my family,
I think much of its repute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with that he broke up the talk, which was the first we had
together in such confidence.&nbsp; But the same afternoon I had
the proof that his father was perfectly acquainted with the
business, and that it was only from his wife that Mr. Henry kept
it secret.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fear you had a painful errand to-day,&rdquo; says my
lord to me, &ldquo;for which, as it enters in no way among your
duties, I wish to thank you, and to remind you at the same time
(in case Mr. Henry should have neglected) how very desirable it
is that no word of it should reach my daughter.&nbsp; Reflections
on the dead, Mr. Mackellar, are doubly painful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anger glowed in my heart; and I could have told my lord to his
face how little he had to do, bolstering up the image of the dead
in Mrs. Henry&rsquo;s heart, and how much better he were employed
to shatter that false idol; for by this time I saw very well how
the land lay between my patron and his wife.</p>
<p>My pen is clear enough to tell a plain tale; but to render the
effect of an infinity of small things, not one great enough in
itself to be narrated; and to translate the story of looks, and
the message of voices when they are saying no great matter; and
to put in half a page the essence of near eighteen
months&mdash;this is what I despair to accomplish.&nbsp; The
fault, to be very blunt, lay all in Mrs. Henry.&nbsp; She felt it
a merit to have consented to the marriage, and she took it like a
martyrdom; in which my old lord, whether he knew it or not,
fomented her.&nbsp; She made a merit, besides, of her constancy
to the dead, though its name, to a nicer conscience, should have
seemed rather disloyalty to the living; and here also my lord
gave her his countenance.&nbsp; I suppose he was glad to talk of
his loss, and ashamed to dwell on it with Mr. Henry.&nbsp;
Certainly, at least, he made a little coterie apart in that
family of three, and it was the husband who was shut out.&nbsp;
It seems it was an old custom when the family were alone in
Durrisdeer, that my lord should take his wine to the
chimney-side, and Miss Alison, instead of withdrawing, should
bring a stool to his knee, and chatter to him privately; and
after she had become my patron&rsquo;s wife the same manner of
doing was continued.&nbsp; It should have been pleasant to behold
this ancient gentleman so loving with his daughter, but I was too
much a partisan of Mr. Henry&rsquo;s to be anything but wroth at
his exclusion.&nbsp; Many&rsquo;s the time I have seen him make
an obvious resolve, quit the table, and go and join himself to
his wife and my Lord Durrisdeer; and on their part, they were
never backward to make him welcome, turned to him smilingly as to
an intruding child, and took him into their talk with an effort
so ill-concealed that he was soon back again beside me at the
table, whence (so great is the hall of Durrisdeer) we could but
hear the murmur of voices at the chimney.&nbsp; There he would
sit and watch, and I along with him; and sometimes by my
lord&rsquo;s head sorrowfully shaken, or his hand laid on Mrs.
Henry&rsquo;s head, or hers upon his knee as if in consolation,
or sometimes by an exchange of tearful looks, we would draw our
conclusion that the talk had gone to the old subject and the
shadow of the dead was in the hall.</p>
<p>I have hours when I blame Mr. Henry for taking all too
patiently; yet we are to remember he was married in pity, and
accepted his wife upon that term.&nbsp; And, indeed, he had small
encouragement to make a stand.&nbsp; Once, I remember, he
announced he had found a man to replace the pane of the stained
window, which, as it was he that managed all the business, was a
thing clearly within his attributions.&nbsp; But to the
Master&rsquo;s fancies, that pane was like a relic; and on the
first word of any change, the blood flew to Mrs. Henry&rsquo;s
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder at you!&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder at myself,&rdquo; says Mr. Henry, with more of
bitterness than I had ever heard him to express.</p>
<p>Thereupon my old lord stepped in with his smooth talk, so that
before the meal was at an end all seemed forgotten; only that,
after dinner, when the pair had withdrawn as usual to the
chimney-side, we could see her weeping with her head upon his
knee.&nbsp; Mr. Henry kept up the talk with me upon some topic of
the estates&mdash;he could speak of little else but business, and
was never the best of company; but he kept it up that day with
more continuity, his eye straying ever and again to the chimney,
and his voice changing to another key, but without check of
delivery.&nbsp; The pane, however, was not replaced; and I
believe he counted it a great defeat.</p>
<p>Whether he was stout enough or no, God knows he was kind
enough.&nbsp; Mrs. Henry had a manner of condescension with him,
such as (in a wife) would have pricked my vanity into an ulcer;
he took it like a favour.&nbsp; She held him at the staff&rsquo;s
end; forgot and then remembered and unbent to him, as we do to
children; burthened him with cold kindness; reproved him with a
change of colour and a bitten lip, like one shamed by his
disgrace: ordered him with a look of the eye, when she was off
her guard; when she was on the watch, pleaded with him for the
most natural attentions, as though they were unheard-of
favours.&nbsp; And to all this he replied with the most unwearied
service, loving, as folk say, the very ground she trod on, and
carrying that love in his eyes as bright as a lamp.&nbsp; When
Miss Katharine was to be born, nothing would serve but he must
stay in the room behind the head of the bed.&nbsp; There he sat,
as white (they tell me) as a sheet, and the sweat dropping from
his brow; and the handkerchief he had in his hand was crushed
into a little ball no bigger than a musket-bullet.&nbsp; Nor
could he bear the sight of Miss Katharine for many a day; indeed,
I doubt if he was ever what he should have been to my young lady;
for the which want of natural feeling he was loudly blamed.</p>
<p>Such was the state of this family down to the 7th April, 1749,
when there befell the first of that series of events which were
to break so many hearts and lose so many lives.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>On that day I was sitting in my room a little before supper,
when John Paul burst open the door with no civility of knocking,
and told me there was one below that wished to speak with the
steward; sneering at the name of my office.</p>
<p>I asked what manner of man, and what his name was; and this
disclosed the cause of John&rsquo;s ill-humour; for it appeared
the visitor refused to name himself except to me, a sore affront
to the major-domo&rsquo;s consequence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, smiling a little, &ldquo;I will
see what he wants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I found in the entrance hall a big man, very plainly habited,
and wrapped in a sea-cloak, like one new landed, as indeed he
was.&nbsp; Not, far off Macconochie was standing, with his tongue
out of his mouth and his hand upon his chin, like a dull fellow
thinking hard; and the stranger, who had brought his cloak about
his face, appeared uneasy.&nbsp; He had no sooner seen me coming
than he went to meet me with an effusive manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear man,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;a thousand
apologies for disturbing you, but I&rsquo;m in the most awkward
position.&nbsp; And there&rsquo;s a son of a ramrod there that I
should know the looks of, and more betoken I believe that he
knows mine.&nbsp; Being in this family, sir, and in a place of
some responsibility (which was the cause I took the liberty to
send for you), you are doubtless of the honest party?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may be sure at least,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;that
all of that party are quite safe in Durrisdeer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear man, it is my very thought,&rdquo; says
he.&nbsp; &ldquo;You see, I have just been set on shore here by a
very honest man, whose name I cannot remember, and who is to
stand off and on for me till morning, at some danger to himself;
and, to be clear with you, I am a little concerned lest it should
be at some to me.&nbsp; I have saved my life so often, Mr.
&mdash;, I forget your name, which is a very good one&mdash;that,
faith, I would be very loath to lose it after all.&nbsp; And the
son of a ramrod, whom I believe I saw before Carlisle . . .
&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, sir,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you can trust
Macconochie until to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, and it&rsquo;s a delight to hear you say
so,&rdquo; says the stranger.&nbsp; &ldquo;The truth is that my
name is not a very suitable one in this country of
Scotland.&nbsp; With a gentleman like you, my dear man, I would
have no concealments of course; and by your leave I&rsquo;ll just
breathe it in your ear.&nbsp; They call me Francis
Burke&mdash;Colonel Francis Burke; and I am here, at a most
damnable risk to myself, to see your masters&mdash;if
you&rsquo;ll excuse me, my good man, for giving them the name,
for I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s a circumstance I would never have
guessed from your appearance.&nbsp; And if you would just be so
very obliging as to take my name to them, you might say that I
come bearing letters which I am sure they will be very rejoiced
to have the reading of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colonel Francis Burke was one of the Prince&rsquo;s Irishmen,
that did his cause such an infinity of hurt, and were so much
distasted of the Scots at the time of the rebellion; and it came
at once into my mind, how the Master of Ballantrae had astonished
all men by going with that party.&nbsp; In the same moment a
strong foreboding of the truth possessed my soul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you will step in here,&rdquo; said I, opening a
chamber door, &ldquo;I will let my lord know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I am sure it&rsquo;s very good of you, Mr.
What-is-your-name,&rdquo; says the Colonel.</p>
<p>Up to the hall I went, slow-footed.&nbsp; There they were, all
three&mdash;my old lord in his place, Mrs. Henry at work by the
window, Mr. Henry (as was much his custom) pacing the low
end.&nbsp; In the midst was the table laid for supper.&nbsp; I
told them briefly what I had to say.&nbsp; My old lord lay back
in his seat.&nbsp; Mrs. Henry sprang up standing with a
mechanical motion, and she and her husband stared at each
other&rsquo;s eyes across the room; it was the strangest,
challenging look these two exchanged, and as they looked, the
colour faded in their faces.&nbsp; Then Mr. Henry turned to me;
not to speak, only to sign with his finger; but that was enough,
and I went down again for the Colonel.</p>
<p>When we returned, these three were in much the same position I
same left them in; I believe no word had passed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My Lord Durrisdeer, no doubt?&rdquo; says the Colonel,
bowing, and my lord bowed in answer.&nbsp; &ldquo;And
this,&rdquo; continues the Colonel, &ldquo;should be the Master
of Ballantrae?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have never taken that name,&rdquo; said Mr. Henry;
&ldquo;but I am Henry Durie, at your service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Colonel turns to Mrs. Henry, bowing with his hat upon
his heart and the most killing airs of gallantry.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There can be no mistake about so fine a figure of a
lady,&rdquo; says he.&nbsp; &ldquo;I address the seductive Miss
Alison, of whom I have so often heard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once more husband and wife exchanged a look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Mrs. Henry Durie,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;but
before my marriage my name was Alison Graeme.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then my lord spoke up.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am an old man, Colonel
Burke,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and a frail one.&nbsp; It will be
mercy on your part to be expeditious.&nbsp; Do you bring me news
of&mdash;&rdquo; he hesitated, and then the words broke from him
with a singular change of voice&mdash;&ldquo;my son?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear lord, I will be round with you like a
soldier,&rdquo; said the Colonel.&nbsp; &ldquo;I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My lord held out a wavering hand; he seemed to wave a signal,
but whether it was to give him time or to speak on, was more than
we could guess.&nbsp; At length he got out the one word,
&ldquo;Good?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, the very best in the creation!&rdquo; cries the
Colonel.&nbsp; &ldquo;For my good friend and admired comrade is
at this hour in the fine city of Paris, and as like as not, if I
know anything of his habits, he will be drawing in his chair to a
piece of dinner.&mdash;Bedad, I believe the lady&rsquo;s
fainting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Henry was indeed the colour of death, and drooped against
the window-frame.&nbsp; But when Mr. Henry made a movement as if
to run to her, she straightened with a sort of shiver.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I am well,&rdquo; she said, with her white lips.</p>
<p>Mr. Henry stopped, and his face had a strong twitch of
anger.&nbsp; The next moment he had turned to the Colonel.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You must not blame yourself,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;for
this effect on Mrs. Durie.&nbsp; It is only natural; we were all
brought up like brother and sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Henry looked at her husband with something like relief or
even gratitude.&nbsp; In my way of thinking, that speech was the
first step he made in her good graces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must try to forgive me, Mrs. Durie, for indeed and
I am just an Irish savage,&rdquo; said the Colonel; &ldquo;and I
deserve to be shot for not breaking the matter more artistically
to a lady.&nbsp; But here are the Master&rsquo;s own letters; one
for each of the three of you; and to be sure (if I know anything
of my friend&rsquo;s genius) he will tell his own story with a
better grace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He brought the three letters forth as he spoke, arranged them
by their superscriptions, presented the first to my lord, who
took it greedily, and advanced towards Mrs. Henry holding out the
second.</p>
<p>But the lady waved it back.&nbsp; &ldquo;To my husband,&rdquo;
says she, with a choked voice.</p>
<p>The Colonel was a quick man, but at this he was somewhat
nonplussed.&nbsp; &ldquo;To be sure!&rdquo; says he; &ldquo;how
very dull of me!&nbsp; To be sure!&rdquo;&nbsp; But he still held
the letter.</p>
<p>At last Mr. Henry reached forth his hand, and there was
nothing to be done but give it up.&nbsp; Mr. Henry took the
letters (both hers and his own), and looked upon their outside,
with his brows knit hard, as if he were thinking.&nbsp; He had
surprised me all through by his excellent behaviour; but he was
to excel himself now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me give you a hand to your room,&rdquo; said he to
his wife.&nbsp; &ldquo;This has come something of the suddenest;
and, at any rate, you will wish to read your letter by
yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again she looked upon him with the same thought of wonder; but
he gave her no time, coming straight to where she stood.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It will be better so, believe me,&rdquo; said he;
&ldquo;and Colonel Burke is too considerate not to excuse
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; And with that he took her hand by the fingers,
and led her from the hall.</p>
<p>Mrs. Henry returned no more that night; and when Mr. Henry
went to visit her next morning, as I heard long afterwards, she
gave him the letter again, still unopened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, read it and be done!&rdquo; he had cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spare me that,&rdquo; said she.</p>
<p>And by these two speeches, to my way of thinking, each undid a
great part of what they had previously done well.&nbsp; But the
letter, sure enough, came into my hands, and by me was burned,
unopened.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>To be very exact as to the adventures of the Master after
Culloden, I wrote not long ago to Colonel Burke, now a Chevalier
of the Order of St. Louis, begging him for some notes in writing,
since I could scarce depend upon my memory at so great an
interval.&nbsp; To confess the truth, I have been somewhat
embarrassed by his response; for he sent me the complete memoirs
of his life, touching only in places on the Master; running to a
much greater length than my whole story, and not everywhere (as
it seems to me) designed for edification.&nbsp; He begged in his
letter, dated from Ettenheim, that I would find a publisher for
the whole, after I had made what use of it I required; and I
think I shall best answer my own purpose and fulfil his wishes by
printing certain parts of it in full.&nbsp; In this way my
readers will have a detailed, and, I believe, a very genuine
account of some essential matters; and if any publisher should
take a fancy to the Chevalier&rsquo;s manner of narration, he
knows where to apply for the rest, of which there is plenty at
his service.&nbsp; I put in my first extract here, so that it may
stand in the place of what the Chevalier told us over our wine in
the hall of Durrisdeer; but you are to suppose it was not the
brutal fact, but a very varnished version that he offered to my
lord.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER III.&mdash;THE MASTER&rsquo;S WANDERINGS.</h2>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>From the Memoirs of the
Chevalier de Burke</i>.</p>
<p>. . . I left Ruthven (it&rsquo;s hardly necessary to remark)
with much greater satisfaction than I had come to it; but whether
I missed my way in the deserts, or whether my companions failed
me, I soon found myself alone.&nbsp; This was a predicament very
disagreeable; for I never understood this horrid country or
savage people, and the last stroke of the Prince&rsquo;s
withdrawal had made us of the Irish more unpopular than
ever.&nbsp; I was reflecting on my poor chances, when I saw
another horseman on the hill, whom I supposed at first to have
been a phantom, the news of his death in the very front at
Culloden being current in the army generally.&nbsp; This was the
Master of Ballantrae, my Lord Durrisdeer&rsquo;s son, a young
nobleman of the rarest gallantry and parts, and equally designed
by nature to adorn a Court and to reap laurels in the
field.&nbsp; Our meeting was the more welcome to both, as he was
one of the few Scots who had used the Irish with consideration,
and as he might now be of very high utility in aiding my
escape.&nbsp; Yet what founded our particular friendship was a
circumstance, by itself as romantic as any fable of King
Arthur.</p>
<p>This was on the second day of our flight, after we had slept
one night in the rain upon the inclination of a mountain.&nbsp;
There was an Appin man, Alan Black Stewart (or some such name, <a
name="citation2"></a><a href="#footnote2"
class="citation">[2]</a> but I have seen him since in France) who
chanced to be passing the same way, and had a jealousy of my
companion.&nbsp; Very uncivil expressions were exchanged; and
Stewart calls upon the Master to alight and have it out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Mr. Stewart,&rdquo; says the Master, &ldquo;I
think at the present time I would prefer to run a race with
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; And with the word claps spurs to his horse.</p>
<p>Stewart ran after us, a childish thing to do, for more than a
mile; and I could not help laughing, as I looked back at last and
saw him on a hill, holding his hand to his side, and nearly burst
with running.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, all the same,&rdquo; I could not help saying to my
companion, &ldquo;I would let no man run after me for any such
proper purpose, and not give him his desire.&nbsp; It was a good
jest, but it smells a trifle cowardly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He bent his brows at me.&nbsp; &ldquo;I do pretty well,&rdquo;
says he, &ldquo;when I saddle myself with the most unpopular man
in Scotland, and let that suffice for courage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, bedad,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;I could show you a more
unpopular with the naked eye.&nbsp; And if you like not my
company, you can &lsquo;saddle&rsquo; yourself on some one
else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Colonel Burke,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;do not let us
quarrel; and, to that effect, let me assure you I am the least
patient man in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am as little patient as yourself,&rdquo; said
I.&nbsp; &ldquo;I care not who knows that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At this rate,&rdquo; says he, reining in, &ldquo;we
shall not go very far.&nbsp; And I propose we do one of two
things upon the instant: either quarrel and be done; or make a
sure bargain to bear everything at each other&rsquo;s
hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like a pair of brothers?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said no such foolishness,&rdquo; he replied.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I have a brother of my own, and I think no more of him
than of a colewort.&nbsp; But if we are to have our noses rubbed
together in this course of flight, let us each dare to be
ourselves like savages, and each swear that he will neither
resent nor deprecate the other.&nbsp; I am a pretty bad fellow at
bottom, and I find the pretence of virtues very
irksome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, I am as bad as yourself,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There is no skim milk in Francis Burke.&nbsp; But which is
it to be?&nbsp; Fight or make friends?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;I think it will be the best
manner to spin a coin for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This proposition was too highly chivalrous not to take my
fancy; and, strange as it may seem of two well-born gentlemen of
to-day, we span a half-crown (like a pair of ancient paladins)
whether we were to cut each other&rsquo;s throats or be sworn
friends.&nbsp; A more romantic circumstance can rarely have
occurred; and it is one of those points in my memoirs, by which
we may see the old tales of Homer and the poets are equally true
to-day&mdash;at least, of the noble and genteel.&nbsp; The coin
fell for peace, and we shook hands upon our bargain.&nbsp; And
then it was that my companion explained to me his thought in
running away from Mr. Stewart, which was certainly worthy of his
political intellect.&nbsp; The report of his death, he said, was
a great guard to him; Mr. Stewart having recognised him, had
become a danger; and he had taken the briefest road to that
gentleman&rsquo;s silence.&nbsp; &ldquo;For,&rdquo; says he,
&ldquo;Alan Black is too vain a man to narrate any such story of
himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Towards afternoon we came down to the shores of that loch for
which we were heading; and there was the ship, but newly come to
anchor.&nbsp; She was the <i>Sainte-Marie-des-Anges</i>, out of
the port of Havre-de-Grace.&nbsp; The Master, after we had
signalled for a boat, asked me if I knew the captain.&nbsp; I
told him he was a countryman of mine, of the most unblemished
integrity, but, I was afraid, a rather timorous man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No matter,&rdquo; says he.&nbsp; &ldquo;For all that,
he should certainly hear the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I asked him if he meant about the battle? for if the captain
once knew the standard was down, he would certainly put to sea
again at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And even then!&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;the arms are now
of no sort of utility.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear man,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;who thinks of the
arms?&nbsp; But, to be sure, we must remember our friends.&nbsp;
They will be close upon our heels, perhaps the Prince himself,
and if the ship be gone, a great number of valuable lives may be
imperilled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The captain and the crew have lives also, if you come
to that,&rdquo; says Ballantrae.</p>
<p>This I declared was but a quibble, and that I would not hear
of the captain being told; and then it was that Ballantrae made
me a witty answer, for the sake of which (and also because I have
been blamed myself in this business of the
<i>Sainte-Marie-des-Anges</i>) I have related the whole
conversation as it passed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Frank,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;remember our
bargain.&nbsp; I must not object to your holding your tongue,
which I hereby even encourage you to do; but, by the same terms,
you are not to resent my telling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I could not help laughing at this; though I still forewarned
him what would come of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The devil may come of it for what I care,&rdquo; says
the reckless fellow.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have always done exactly as I
felt inclined.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As is well known, my prediction came true.&nbsp; The captain
had no sooner heard the news than he cut his cable and to sea
again; and before morning broke, we were in the Great Minch.</p>
<p>The ship was very old; and the skipper, although the most
honest of men (and Irish too), was one of the least
capable.&nbsp; The wind blew very boisterous, and the sea raged
extremely.&nbsp; All that day we had little heart whether to eat
or drink; went early to rest in some concern of mind; and (as if
to give us a lesson) in the night the wind chopped suddenly into
the north-east, and blew a hurricane.&nbsp; We were awaked by the
dreadful thunder of the tempest and the stamping of the mariners
on deck; so that I supposed our last hour was certainly come; and
the terror of my mind was increased out of all measure by
Ballantrae, who mocked at my devotions.&nbsp; It is in hours like
these that a man of any piety appears in his true light, and we
find (what we are taught as babes) the small trust that can be
set in worldly friends.&nbsp; I would be unworthy of my religion
if I let this pass without particular remark.&nbsp; For three
days we lay in the dark in the cabin, and had but a biscuit to
nibble.&nbsp; On the fourth the wind fell, leaving the ship
dismasted and heaving on vast billows.&nbsp; The captain had not
a guess of whither we were blown; he was stark ignorant of his
trade, and could do naught but bless the Holy Virgin; a very good
thing, too, but scarce the whole of seamanship.&nbsp; It seemed,
our one hope was to be picked up by another vessel; and if that
should prove to be an English ship, it might be no great blessing
to the Master and myself.</p>
<p>The fifth and sixth days we tossed there helpless.&nbsp; The
seventh some sail was got on her, but she was an unwieldy vessel
at the best, and we made little but leeway.&nbsp; All the time,
indeed, we had been drifting to the south and west, and during
the tempest must have driven in that direction with unheard-of
violence.&nbsp; The ninth dawn was cold and black, with a great
sea running, and every mark of foul weather.&nbsp; In this
situation we were overjoyed to sight a small ship on the horizon,
and to perceive her go about and head for the
<i>Sainte-Marie</i>.&nbsp; But our gratification did not very
long endure; for when she had laid to and lowered a boat, it was
immediately filled with disorderly fellows, who sang and shouted
as they pulled across to us, and swarmed in on our deck with bare
cutlasses, cursing loudly.&nbsp; Their leader was a horrible
villain, with his face blacked and his whiskers curled in
ringlets; Teach, his name; a most notorious pirate.&nbsp; He
stamped about the deck, raving and crying out that his name was
Satan, and his ship was called Hell.&nbsp; There was something
about him like a wicked child or a half-witted person, that
daunted me beyond expression.&nbsp; I whispered in the ear of
Ballantrae that I would not be the last to volunteer, and only
prayed God they might be short of hands; he approved my purpose
with a nod.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bedad,&rdquo; said I to Master Teach, &ldquo;if you are
Satan, here is a devil for ye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The word pleased him; and (not to dwell upon these shocking
incidents) Ballantrae and I and two others were taken for
recruits, while the skipper and all the rest were cast into the
sea by the method of walking the plank.&nbsp; It was the first
time I had seen this done; my heart died within me at the
spectacle; and Master Teach or one of his acolytes (for my head
was too much lost to be precise) remarked upon my pale face in a
very alarming manner.&nbsp; I had the strength to cut a step or
two of a jig, and cry out some ribaldry, which saved me for that
time; but my legs were like water when I must get down into the
skiff among these miscreants; and what with my horror of my
company and fear of the monstrous billows, it was all I could do
to keep an Irish tongue and break a jest or two as we were pulled
aboard.&nbsp; By the blessing of God, there was a fiddle in the
pirate ship, which I had no sooner seen than I fell upon; and in
my quality of crowder I had the heavenly good luck to get favour
in their eyes. <i>Crowding Pat</i> was the name they dubbed me
with; and it was little I cared for a name so long as my skin was
whole.</p>
<p>What kind of a pandemonium that vessel was, I cannot describe,
but she was commanded by a lunatic, and might be called a
floating Bedlam.&nbsp; Drinking, roaring, singing, quarrelling,
dancing, they were never all sober at one time; and there were
days together when, if a squall had supervened, it must have sent
us to the bottom; or if a king&rsquo;s ship had come along, it
would have found us quite helpless for defence.&nbsp; Once or
twice we sighted a sail, and, if we were sober enough, overhauled
it, God forgive us! and if we were all too drunk, she got away,
and I would bless the saints under my breath.&nbsp; Teach ruled,
if you can call that rule which brought no order, by the terror
he created; and I observed the man was very vain of his
position.&nbsp; I have known marshals of France&mdash;ay, and
even Highland chieftains&mdash;that were less openly puffed up;
which throws a singular light on the pursuit of honour and
glory.&nbsp; Indeed, the longer we live, the more we perceive the
sagacity of Aristotle and the other old philosophers; and though
I have all my life been eager for legitimate distinctions, I can
lay my hand upon my heart, at the end of my career, and declare
there is not one&mdash;no, nor yet life itself&mdash;which is
worth acquiring or preserving at the slightest cost of
dignity.</p>
<p>It was long before I got private speech of Ballantrae; but at
length one night we crept out upon the boltsprit, when the rest
were better employed, and commiserated our position.</p>
<p>&ldquo;None can deliver us but the saints,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mind is very different,&rdquo; said Ballantrae;
&ldquo;for I am going to deliver myself.&nbsp; This Teach is the
poorest creature possible; we make no profit of him, and lie
continually open to capture; and,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;I am not
going to be a tarry pirate for nothing, nor yet to hang in chains
if I can help it.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he told me what was in his
mind to better the state of the ship in the way of discipline,
which would give us safety for the present, and a sooner hope of
deliverance when they should have gained enough and should break
up their company.</p>
<p>I confessed to him ingenuously that my nerve was quite shook
amid these horrible surroundings, and I durst scarce tell him to
count upon me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not very easy frightened,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;nor very easy beat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few days after, there befell an accident which had nearly
hanged us all; and offers the most extraordinary picture of the
folly that ruled in our concerns.&nbsp; We were all pretty drunk:
and some bedlamite spying a sail, Teach put the ship about in
chase without a glance, and we began to bustle up the arms and
boast of the horrors that should follow.&nbsp; I observed
Ballantrae stood quiet in the bows, looking under the shade of
his hand; but for my part, true to my policy among these savages,
I was at work with the busiest and passing Irish jests for their
diversion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Run up the colours,&rdquo; cries Teach.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Show the &mdash;s the Jolly Roger!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the merest drunken braggadocio at such a stage, and
might have lost us a valuable prize; but I thought it no part of
mine to reason, and I ran up the black flag with my own hand.</p>
<p>Ballantrae steps presently aft with a smile upon his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may perhaps like to know, you drunken dog,&rdquo;
says he, &ldquo;that you are chasing a king&rsquo;s
ship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Teach roared him the lie; but he ran at the same time to the
bulwarks, and so did they all.&nbsp; I have never seen so many
drunken men struck suddenly sober.&nbsp; The cruiser had gone
about, upon our impudent display of colours; she was just then
filling on the new tack; her ensign blew out quite plain to see;
and even as we stared, there came a puff of smoke, and then a
report, and a shot plunged in the waves a good way short of
us.&nbsp; Some ran to the ropes, and got the <i>Sarah</i> round
with an incredible swiftness.&nbsp; One fellow fell on the rum
barrel, which stood broached upon the deck, and rolled it
promptly overboard.&nbsp; On my part, I made for the Jolly Roger,
struck it, tossed it in the sea; and could have flung myself
after, so vexed was I with our mismanagement.&nbsp; As for Teach,
he grew as pale as death, and incontinently went down to his
cabin.&nbsp; Only twice he came on deck that afternoon; went to
the taffrail; took a long look at the king&rsquo;s ship, which
was still on the horizon heading after us; and then, without
speech, back to his cabin.&nbsp; You may say he deserted us; and
if it had not been for one very capable sailor we had on board,
and for the lightness of the airs that blew all day, we must
certainly have gone to the yard-arm.</p>
<p>It is to be supposed Teach was humiliated, and perhaps alarmed
for his position with the crew; and the way in which he set about
regaining what he had lost, was highly characteristic of the
man.&nbsp; Early next day we smelled him burning sulphur in his
cabin and crying out of &ldquo;Hell, hell!&rdquo; which was well
understood among the crew, and filled their minds with
apprehension.&nbsp; Presently he comes on deck, a perfect figure
of fun, his face blacked, his hair and whiskers curled, his belt
stuck full of pistols; chewing bits of glass so that the blood
ran down his chin, and brandishing a dirk.&nbsp; I do not know if
he had taken these manners from the Indians of America, where he
was a native; but such was his way, and he would always thus
announce that he was wound up to horrid deeds.&nbsp; The first
that came near him was the fellow who had sent the rum overboard
the day before; him he stabbed to the heart, damning him for a
mutineer; and then capered about the body, raving and swearing
and daring us to come on.&nbsp; It was the silliest exhibition;
and yet dangerous too, for the cowardly fellow was plainly
working himself up to another murder.</p>
<p>All of a sudden Ballantrae stepped forth.&nbsp; &ldquo;Have
done with this play-acting,&rdquo; says he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you
think to frighten us with making faces?&nbsp; We saw nothing of
you yesterday, when you were wanted; and we did well without you,
let me tell you that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a murmur and a movement in the crew, of pleasure and
alarm, I thought, in nearly equal parts.&nbsp; As for Teach, he
gave a barbarous howl, and swung his dirk to fling it, an art in
which (like many seamen) he was very expert.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Knock that out of his hand!&rdquo; says Ballantrae, so
sudden and sharp that my arm obeyed him before my mind had
understood.</p>
<p>Teach stood like one stupid, never thinking on his
pistols.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go down to your cabin,&rdquo; cries Ballantrae,
&ldquo;and come on deck again when you are sober.&nbsp; Do you
think we are going to hang for you, you black-faced, half-witted,
drunken brute and butcher?&nbsp; Go down!&rdquo;&nbsp; And he
stamped his foot at him with such a sudden smartness that Teach
fairly ran for it to the companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, mates,&rdquo; says Ballantrae, &ldquo;a word
with you.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know if you are gentlemen of
fortune for the fun of the thing, but I am not.&nbsp; I want to
make money, and get ashore again, and spend it like a man.&nbsp;
And on one thing my mind is made up: I will not hang if I can
help it.&nbsp; Come: give me a hint; I&rsquo;m only a
beginner!&nbsp; Is there no way to get a little discipline and
common sense about this business?&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the men spoke up: he said by rights they should have a
quartermaster; and no sooner was the word out of his mouth than
they were all of that opinion.&nbsp; The thing went by
acclamation, Ballantrae was made quartermaster, the rum was put
in his charge, laws were passed in imitation of those of a pirate
by the name of Roberts, and the last proposal was to make an end
of Teach.&nbsp; But Ballantrae was afraid of a more efficient
captain, who might be a counterweight to himself, and he opposed
this stoutly.&nbsp; Teach, he said, was good enough to board
ships and frighten fools with his blacked face and swearing; we
could scarce get a better man than Teach for that; and besides,
as the man was now disconsidered and as good as deposed, we might
reduce his proportion of the plunder.&nbsp; This carried it;
Teach&rsquo;s share was cut down to a mere derision, being
actually less than mine; and there remained only two points:
whether he would consent, and who was to announce to him this
resolution.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not let that stick you,&rdquo; says Ballantrae,
&ldquo;I will do that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he stepped to the companion and down alone into the cabin
to face that drunken savage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the man for us,&rdquo; cries one of the
hands.&nbsp; &ldquo;Three cheers for the quartermaster!&rdquo;
which were given with a will, my own voice among the loudest, and
I dare say these plaudits had their effect on Master Teach in the
cabin, as we have seen of late days how shouting in the streets
may trouble even the minds of legislators.</p>
<p>What passed precisely was never known, though some of the
heads of it came to the surface later on; and we were all amazed,
as well as gratified, when Ballantrae came on deck with Teach
upon his arm, and announced that all had been consented.</p>
<p>I pass swiftly over those twelve or fifteen months in which we
continued to keep the sea in the North Atlantic, getting our food
and water from the ships we over-hauled, and doing on the whole a
pretty fortunate business.&nbsp; Sure, no one could wish to read
anything so ungenteel as the memoirs of a pirate, even an
unwilling one like me!&nbsp; Things went extremely better with
our designs, and Ballantrae kept his lead, to my admiration, from
that day forth.&nbsp; I would be tempted to suppose that a
gentleman must everywhere be first, even aboard a rover: but my
birth is every whit as good as any Scottish lord&rsquo;s, and I
am not ashamed to confess that I stayed Crowding Pat until the
end, and was not much better than the crew&rsquo;s buffoon.&nbsp;
Indeed, it was no scene to bring out my merits.&nbsp; My health
suffered from a variety of reasons; I was more at home to the
last on a horse&rsquo;s back than a ship&rsquo;s deck; and, to be
ingenuous, the fear of the sea was constantly in my mind,
battling with the fear of my companions.&nbsp; I need not cry
myself up for courage; I have done well on many fields under the
eyes of famous generals, and earned my late advancement by an act
of the most distinguished valour before many witnesses.&nbsp; But
when we must proceed on one of our abordages, the heart of
Francis Burke was in his boots; the little eggshell skiff in
which we must set forth, the horrible heaving of the vast
billows, the height of the ship that we must scale, the thought
of how many might be there in garrison upon their legitimate
defence, the scowling heavens which (in that climate) so often
looked darkly down upon our exploits, and the mere crying of the
wind in my ears, were all considerations most unpalatable to my
valour.&nbsp; Besides which, as I was always a creature of the
nicest sensibility, the scenes that must follow on our success
tempted me as little as the chances of defeat.&nbsp; Twice we
found women on board; and though I have seen towns sacked, and of
late days in France some very horrid public tumults, there was
something in the smallness of the numbers engaged, and the bleak
dangerous sea-surroundings, that made these acts of piracy far
the most revolting.&nbsp; I confess ingenuously I could never
proceed unless I was three parts drunk; it was the same even with
the crew; Teach himself was fit for no enterprise till he was
full of rum; and it was one of the most difficult parts of
Ballantrae&rsquo;s performance, to serve us with liquor in the
proper quantities.&nbsp; Even this he did to admiration; being
upon the whole the most capable man I ever met with, and the one
of the most natural genius.&nbsp; He did not even scrape favour
with the crew, as I did, by continual buffoonery made upon a very
anxious heart; but preserved on most occasions a great deal of
gravity and distance; so that he was like a parent among a family
of young children, or a schoolmaster with his boys.&nbsp; What
made his part the harder to perform, the men were most inveterate
grumblers; Ballantrae&rsquo;s discipline, little as it was, was
yet irksome to their love of licence; and what was worse, being
kept sober they had time to think.&nbsp; Some of them accordingly
would fall to repenting their abominable crimes; one in
particular, who was a good Catholic, and with whom I would
sometimes steal apart for prayer; above all in bad weather, fogs,
lashing rain and the like, when we would be the less observed;
and I am sure no two criminals in the cart have ever performed
their devotions with more anxious sincerity.&nbsp; But the rest,
having no such grounds of hope, fell to another pastime, that of
computation.&nbsp; All day long they would he telling up their
shares or grooming over the result.&nbsp; I have said we were
pretty fortunate.&nbsp; But an observation fails to be made: that
in this world, in no business that I have tried, do the profits
rise to a man&rsquo;s expectations.&nbsp; We found many ships and
took many; yet few of them contained much money, their goods were
usually nothing to our purpose&mdash;what did we want with a
cargo of ploughs, or even of tobacco?&mdash;and it is quite a
painful reflection how many whole crews we have made to walk the
plank for no more than a stock of biscuit or an anker or two of
spirit.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile our ship was growing very foul, and it was
high time we should make for our <i>port de carr&eacute;nage</i>,
which was in the estuary of a river among swamps.&nbsp; It was
openly understood that we should then break up and go and
squander our proportions of the spoil; and this made every man
greedy of a little more, so that our decision was delayed from
day to day.&nbsp; What finally decided matters, was a trifling
accident, such as an ignorant person might suppose incidental to
our way of life.&nbsp; But here I must explain: on only one of
all the ships we boarded, the first on which we found women, did
we meet with any genuine resistance.&nbsp; On that occasion we
had two men killed and several injured, and if it had not been
for the gallantry of Ballantrae we had surely been beat back at
last.&nbsp; Everywhere else the defence (where there was any at
all) was what the worst troops in Europe would have laughed at;
so that the most dangerous part of our employment was to clamber
up the side of the ship; and I have even known the poor souls on
board to cast us a line, so eager were they to volunteer instead
of walking the plank.&nbsp; This constant immunity had made our
fellows very soft, so that I understood how Teach had made so
deep a mark upon their minds; for indeed the company of that
lunatic was the chief danger in our way of life.&nbsp; The
accident to which I have referred was this:&mdash;We had sighted
a little full-rigged ship very close under our board in a haze;
she sailed near as well as we did&mdash;I should be nearer truth
if I said, near as ill; and we cleared the bow-chaser to see if
we could bring a spar or two about their ears.&nbsp; The swell
was exceeding great; the motion of the ship beyond description;
it was little wonder if our gunners should fire thrice and be
still quite broad of what they aimed at.&nbsp; But in the
meanwhile the chase had cleared a stern gun, the thickness of the
air concealing them; and being better marksmen, their first shot
struck us in the bows, knocked our two gunners into mince-meat,
so that we were all sprinkled with the blood, and plunged through
the deck into the forecastle, where we slept.&nbsp; Ballantrae
would have held on; indeed, there was nothing in this
<i>contretemps</i> to affect the mind of any soldier; but he had
a quick perception of the men&rsquo;s wishes, and it was plain
this lucky shot had given them a sickener of their trade.&nbsp;
In a moment they were all of one mind: the chase was drawing away
from us, it was needless to hold on, the <i>Sarah</i> was too
foul to overhaul a bottle, it was mere foolery to keep the sea
with her; and on these pretended grounds her head was
incontinently put about and the course laid for the river.&nbsp;
It was strange to see what merriment fell on that ship&rsquo;s
company, and how they stamped about the deck jesting, and each
computing what increase had come to his share by the death of the
two gunners.</p>
<p>We were nine days making our port, so light were the airs we
had to sail on, so foul the ship&rsquo;s bottom; but early on the
tenth, before dawn, and in a light lifting haze, we passed the
head.&nbsp; A little after, the haze lifted, and fell again,
showing us a cruiser very close.&nbsp; This was a sore blow,
happening so near our refuge.&nbsp; There was a great debate of
whether she had seen us, and if so whether it was likely they had
recognised the <i>Sarah</i>.&nbsp; We were very careful, by
destroying every member of those crews we overhauled, to leave no
evidence as to our own persons; but the appearance of the
<i>Sarah</i> herself we could not keep so private; and above all
of late, since she had been foul, and we had pursued many ships
without success, it was plain that her description had been often
published.&nbsp; I supposed this alert would have made us
separate upon the instant.&nbsp; But here again that original
genius of Ballantrae&rsquo;s had a surprise in store for
me.&nbsp; He and Teach (and it was the most remarkable step of
his success) had gone hand in hand since the first day of his
appointment.&nbsp; I often questioned him upon the fact, and
never got an answer but once, when he told me he and Teach had an
understanding &ldquo;which would very much surprise the crew if
they should hear of it, and would surprise himself a good deal if
it was carried out.&rdquo;&nbsp; Well, here again he and Teach
were of a mind; and by their joint procurement the anchor was no
sooner down than the whole crew went off upon a scene of
drunkenness indescribable.&nbsp; By afternoon we were a mere
shipful of lunatical persons, throwing of things overboard,
howling of different songs at the same time, quarrelling and
falling together, and then forgetting our quarrels to
embrace.&nbsp; Ballantrae had bidden me drink nothing, and feign
drunkenness, as I valued my life; and I have never passed a day
so wearisomely, lying the best part of the time upon the
forecastle and watching the swamps and thickets by which our
little basin was entirely surrounded for the eye.&nbsp; A little
after dusk Ballantrae stumbled up to my side, feigned to fall,
with a drunken laugh, and before he got his feet again, whispered
me to &ldquo;reel down into the cabin and seem to fall asleep
upon a locker, for there would be need of me soon.&rdquo;&nbsp; I
did as I was told, and coming into the cabin, where it was quite
dark, let myself fall on the first locker.&nbsp; There was a man
there already; by the way he stirred and threw me off, I could
not think he was much in liquor; and yet when I had found another
place, he seemed to continue to sleep on.&nbsp; My heart now beat
very hard, for I saw some desperate matter was in act.&nbsp;
Presently down came Ballantrae, lit the lamp, looked about the
cabin, nodded as if pleased, and on deck again without a
word.&nbsp; I peered out from between my fingers, and saw there
were three of us slumbering, or feigning to slumber, on the
lockers: myself, one Dutton and one Grady, both resolute
men.&nbsp; On deck the rest were got to a pitch of revelry quite
beyond the bounds of what is human; so that no reasonable name
can describe the sounds they were now making.&nbsp; I have heard
many a drunken bout in my time, many on board that very
<i>Sarah</i>, but never anything the least like this, which made
me early suppose the liquor had been tampered with.&nbsp; It was
a long while before these yells and howls died out into a sort of
miserable moaning, and then to silence; and it seemed a long
while after that before Ballantrae came down again, this time
with Teach upon his heels.&nbsp; The latter cursed at the sight
of us three upon the lockers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tut,&rdquo; says Ballantrae, &ldquo;you might fire a
pistol at their ears.&nbsp; You know what stuff they have been
swallowing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a hatch in the cabin floor, and under that the
richest part of the booty was stored against the day of
division.&nbsp; It fastened with a ring and three padlocks, the
keys (for greater security) being divided; one to Teach, one to
Ballantrae, and one to the mate, a man called Hammond.&nbsp; Yet
I was amazed to see they were now all in the one hand; and yet
more amazed (still looking through my fingers) to observe
Ballantrae and Teach bring up several packets, four of them in
all, very carefully made up and with a loop for carriage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; says Teach, &ldquo;let us be
going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One word,&rdquo; says Ballantrae.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have
discovered there is another man besides yourself who knows a
private path across the swamp; and it seems it is shorter than
yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Teach cried out, in that case, they were undone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know for that,&rdquo; says Ballantrae.&nbsp;
&ldquo;For there are several other circumstances with which I
must acquaint you.&nbsp; First of all, there is no bullet in your
pistols, which (if you remember) I was kind enough to load for
both of us this morning.&nbsp; Secondly, as there is someone else
who knows a passage, you must think it highly improbable I should
saddle myself with a lunatic like you.&nbsp; Thirdly, these
gentlemen (who need no longer pretend to be asleep) are those of
my party, and will now proceed to gag and bind you to the mast;
and when your men awaken (if they ever do awake after the drugs
we have mingled in their liquor), I am sure they will be so
obliging as to deliver you, and you will have no difficulty, I
daresay, to explain the business of the keys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not a word said Teach, but looked at us like a frightened baby
as we gagged and bound him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you see, you moon-calf,&rdquo; says Ballantrae,
&ldquo;why we made four packets.&nbsp; Heretofore you have been
called Captain Teach, but I think you are now rather Captain
Learn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was our last word on board the <i>Sarah</i>.&nbsp; We
four, with our four packets, lowered ourselves softly into a
skiff, and left that ship behind us as silent as the grave, only
for the moaning of some of the drunkards.&nbsp; There was a fog
about breast-high on the waters; so that Dutton, who knew the
passage, must stand on his feet to direct our rowing; and this,
as it forced us to row gently, was the means of our
deliverance.&nbsp; We were yet but a little way from the ship,
when it began to come grey, and the birds to fly abroad upon the
water.&nbsp; All of a sudden Dutton clapped down upon his hams,
and whispered us to be silent for our lives, and hearken.&nbsp;
Sure enough, we heard a little faint creak of oars upon one hand,
and then again, and further off, a creak of oars upon the
other.&nbsp; It was clear we had been sighted yesterday in the
morning; here were the cruiser&rsquo;s boats to cut us out; here
were we defenceless in their very midst.&nbsp; Sure, never were
poor souls more perilously placed; and as we lay there on our
oars, praying God the mist might hold, the sweat poured from my
brow.&nbsp; Presently we heard one of the boats where we might
have thrown a biscuit in her.&nbsp; &ldquo;Softly, men,&rdquo; we
heard an officer whisper; and I marvelled they could not hear the
drumming of my heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind the path,&rdquo; says Ballantrae; &ldquo;we
must get shelter anyhow; let us pull straight ahead for the sides
of the basin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This we did with the most anxious precaution, rowing, as best
we could, upon our hands, and steering at a venture in the fog,
which was (for all that) our only safety.&nbsp; But Heaven guided
us; we touched ground at a thicket; scrambled ashore with our
treasure; and having no other way of concealment, and the mist
beginning already to lighten, hove down the skiff and let her
sink.&nbsp; We were still but new under cover when the sun rose;
and at the same time, from the midst of the basin, a great
shouting of seamen sprang up, and we knew the <i>Sarah</i> was
being boarded.&nbsp; I heard afterwards the officer that took her
got great honour; and it&rsquo;s true the approach was creditably
managed, but I think he had an easy capture when he came to
board. <a name="citation3"></a><a href="#footnote3"
class="citation">[3]</a></p>
<p>I was still blessing the saints for my escape, when I became
aware we were in trouble of another kind.&nbsp; We were here
landed at random in a vast and dangerous swamp; and how to come
at the path was a concern of doubt, fatigue, and peril.&nbsp;
Dutton, indeed, was of opinion we should wait until the ship was
gone, and fish up the skiff; for any delay would be more wise
than to go blindly ahead in that morass.&nbsp; One went back
accordingly to the basin-side and (peering through the thicket)
saw the fog already quite drunk up, and English colours flying on
the <i>Sarah</i>, but no movement made to get her under
way.&nbsp; Our situation was now very doubtful.&nbsp; The swamp
was an unhealthful place to linger in; we had been so greedy to
bring treasures that we had brought but little food; it was
highly desirable, besides, that we should get clear of the
neighbourhood and into the settlements before the news of the
capture went abroad; and against all these considerations, there
was only the peril of the passage on the other side.&nbsp; I
think it not wonderful we decided on the active part.</p>
<p>It was already blistering hot when we set forth to pass the
marsh, or rather to strike the path, by compass.&nbsp; Dutton
took the compass, and one or other of us three carried his
proportion of the treasure.&nbsp; I promise you he kept a sharp
eye to his rear, for it was like the man&rsquo;s soul that he
must trust us with.&nbsp; The thicket was as close as a bush; the
ground very treacherous, so that we often sank in the most
terrifying manner, and must go round about; the heat, besides,
was stifling, the air singularly heavy, and the stinging insects
abounded in such myriads that each of us walked under his own
cloud.&nbsp; It has often been commented on, how much better
gentlemen of birth endure fatigue than persons of the rabble; so
that walking officers who must tramp in the dirt beside their
men, shame them by their constancy.&nbsp; This was well to be
observed in the present instance; for here were Ballantrae and I,
two gentlemen of the highest breeding, on the one hand; and on
the other, Grady, a common mariner, and a man nearly a giant in
physical strength.&nbsp; The case of Dutton is not in point, for
I confess he did as well as any of us. <a name="citation4"></a><a
href="#footnote4" class="citation">[4]</a>&nbsp; But as for
Grady, he began early to lament his case, tailed in the rear,
refused to carry Dutton&rsquo;s packet when it came his turn,
clamoured continually for rum (of which we had too little), and
at last even threatened us from behind with a cooked pistol,
unless we should allow him rest.&nbsp; Ballantrae would have
fought it out, I believe; but I prevailed with him the other way;
and we made a stop and ate a meal.&nbsp; It seemed to benefit
Grady little; he was in the rear again at once, growling and
bemoaning his lot; and at last, by some carelessness, not having
followed properly in our tracks, stumbled into a deep part of the
slough where it was mostly water, gave some very dreadful
screams, and before we could come to his aid had sunk along with
his booty.&nbsp; His fate, and above all these screams of his,
appalled us to the soul; yet it was on the whole a fortunate
circumstance and the means of our deliverance, for it moved
Dutton to mount into a tree, whence he was able to perceive and
to show me, who had climbed after him, a high piece of the wood,
which was a landmark for the path.&nbsp; He went forward the more
carelessly, I must suppose; for presently we saw him sink a
little down, draw up his feet and sink again, and so twice.&nbsp;
Then he turned his face to us, pretty white.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lend a hand,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I am in a bad
place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that,&rdquo; says Ballantrae,
standing still.</p>
<p>Dutton broke out into the most violent oaths, sinking a little
lower as he did, so that the mud was nearly to his waist, and
plucking a pistol from his belt, &ldquo;Help me,&rdquo; he cries,
&ldquo;or die and be damned to you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; says Ballantrae, &ldquo;I did but
jest.&nbsp; I am coming.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he set down his own
packet and Dutton&rsquo;s, which he was then carrying.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Do not venture near till we see if you are needed,&rdquo;
said he to me, and went forward alone to where the man was
bogged.&nbsp; He was quiet now, though he still held the pistol;
and the marks of terror in his countenance were very moving to
behold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the Lord&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;look
sharp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ballantrae was now got close up.&nbsp; &ldquo;Keep
still,&rdquo; says he, and seemed to consider; and then,
&ldquo;Reach out both your hands!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dutton laid down his pistol, and so watery was the top surface
that it went clear out of sight; with an oath he stooped to
snatch it; and as he did so, Ballantrae leaned forth and stabbed
him between the shoulders.&nbsp; Up went his hands over his
head&mdash;I know not whether with the pain or to ward himself;
and the next moment he doubled forward in the mud.</p>
<p>Ballantrae was already over the ankles; but he plucked himself
out, and came back to me, where I stood with my knees smiting one
another.&nbsp; &ldquo;The devil take you, Francis!&rdquo; says
he.&nbsp; &ldquo;I believe you are a half-hearted fellow, after
all.&nbsp; I have only done justice on a pirate.&nbsp; And here
we are quite clear of the <i>Sarah</i>!&nbsp; Who shall now say
that we have dipped our hands in any irregularities?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I assured him he did me injustice; but my sense of humanity
was so much affected by the horridness of the fact that I could
scarce find breath to answer with.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you must be more
resolved.&nbsp; The need for this fellow ceased when he had shown
you where the path ran; and you cannot deny I would have been
daft to let slip so fair an opportunity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I could not deny but he was right in principle; nor yet could
I refrain from shedding tears, of which I think no man of valour
need have been ashamed; and it was not until I had a share of the
rum that I was able to proceed.&nbsp; I repeat, I am far from
ashamed of my generous emotion; mercy is honourable in the
warrior; and yet I cannot altogether censure Ballantrae, whose
step was really fortunate, as we struck the path without further
misadventure, and the same night, about sundown, came to the edge
of the morass.</p>
<p>We were too weary to seek far; on some dry sands, still warm
with the day&rsquo;s sun, and close under a wood of pines, we lay
down and were instantly plunged in sleep.</p>
<p>We awaked the next morning very early, and began with a sullen
spirit a conversation that came near to end in blows.&nbsp; We
were now cast on shore in the southern provinces, thousands of
miles from any French settlement; a dreadful journey and a
thousand perils lay in front of us; and sure, if there was ever
need for amity, it was in such an hour.&nbsp; I must suppose that
Ballantrae had suffered in his sense of what is truly polite;
indeed, and there is nothing strange in the idea, after the
sea-wolves we had consorted with so long; and as for myself, he
fubbed me off unhandsomely, and any gentleman would have resented
his behaviour.</p>
<p>I told him in what light I saw his conduct; he walked a little
off, I following to upbraid him; and at last he stopped me with
his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Frank,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;you know what we swore;
and yet there is no oath invented would induce me to swallow such
expressions, if I did not regard you with sincere
affection.&nbsp; It is impossible you should doubt me there: I
have given proofs.&nbsp; Dutton I had to take, because he knew
the pass, and Grady because Dutton would not move without him;
but what call was there to carry you along?&nbsp; You are a
perpetual danger to me with your cursed Irish tongue.&nbsp; By
rights you should now be in irons in the cruiser.&nbsp; And you
quarrel with me like a baby for some trinkets!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I considered this one of the most unhandsome speeches ever
made; and indeed to this day I can scarce reconcile it to my
notion of a gentleman that was my friend.&nbsp; I retorted upon
him with his Scotch accent, of which he had not so much as some,
but enough to be very barbarous and disgusting, as I told him
plainly; and the affair would have gone to a great length, but
for an alarming intervention.</p>
<p>We had got some way off upon the sand.&nbsp; The place where
we had slept, with the packets lying undone and the money
scattered openly, was now between us and the pines; and it was
out of these the stranger must have come.&nbsp; There he was at
least, a great hulking fellow of the country, with a broad axe on
his shoulder, looking open-mouthed, now at the treasure, which
was just at his feet, and now at our disputation, in which we had
gone far enough to have weapons in our hands.&nbsp; We had no
sooner observed him than he found his legs and made off again
among the pines.</p>
<p>This was no scene to put our minds at rest: a couple of armed
men in sea-clothes found quarrelling over a treasure, not many
miles from where a pirate had been captured&mdash;here was enough
to bring the whole country about our ears.&nbsp; The quarrel was
not even made up; it was blotted from our minds; and we got our
packets together in the twinkling of an eye, and made off,
running with the best will in the world.&nbsp; But the trouble
was, we did not know in what direction, and must continually
return upon our steps.&nbsp; Ballantrae had indeed collected what
he could from Dutton; but it&rsquo;s hard to travel upon hearsay;
and the estuary, which spreads into a vast irregular harbour,
turned us off upon every side with a new stretch of water.</p>
<p>We were near beside ourselves, and already quite spent with
running, when, coming to the top of a dune, we saw we were again
cut off by another ramification of the bay.&nbsp; This was a
creek, however, very different from those that had arrested us
before; being set in rocks, and so precipitously deep that a
small vessel was able to lie alongside, made fast with a hawser;
and her crew had laid a plank to the shore.&nbsp; Here they had
lighted a fire, and were sitting at their meal.&nbsp; As for the
vessel herself, she was one of those they build in the
Bermudas.</p>
<p>The love of gold and the great hatred that everybody has to
pirates were motives of the most influential, and would certainly
raise the country in our pursuit.&nbsp; Besides, it was now plain
we were on some sort of straggling peninsula, like the fingers of
a hand; and the wrist, or passage to the mainland, which we
should have taken at the first, was by this time not improbably
secured.&nbsp; These considerations put us on a bolder
counsel.&nbsp; For as long as we dared, looking every moment to
hear sounds of the chase, we lay among some bushes on the top of
the dune; and having by this means secured a little breath and
recomposed our appearance, we strolled down at last, with a great
affectation of carelessness, to the party by the fire.</p>
<p>It was a trader and his negroes, belonging to Albany, in the
province of New York, and now on the way home from the Indies
with a cargo; his name I cannot recall.&nbsp; We were amazed to
learn he had put in here from terror of the <i>Sarah</i>; for we
had no thought our exploits had been so notorious.&nbsp; As soon
as the Albanian heard she had been taken the day before, he
jumped to his feet, gave us a cup of spirits for our good news,
and sent big negroes to get sail on the Bermudan.&nbsp; On our
side, we profited by the dram to become more confidential, and at
last offered ourselves as passengers.&nbsp; He looked askance at
our tarry clothes and pistols, and replied civilly enough that he
had scarce accommodation for himself; nor could either our
prayers or our offers of money, in which we advanced pretty far,
avail to shake him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see, you think ill of us,&rdquo; says Ballantrae,
&ldquo;but I will show you how well we think of you by telling
you the truth.&nbsp; We are Jacobite fugitives, and there is a
price upon our heads.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this, the Albanian was plainly moved a little.&nbsp; He
asked us many questions as to the Scotch war, which Ballantrae
very patiently answered.&nbsp; And then, with a wink, in a vulgar
manner, &ldquo;I guess you and your Prince Charlie got more than
you cared about,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bedad, and that we did,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And, my dear man, I wish you would set a new example and
give us just that much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This I said in the Irish way, about which there is allowed to
be something very engaging.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a remarkable thing,
and a testimony to the love with which our nation is regarded,
that this address scarce ever fails in a handsome fellow.&nbsp; I
cannot tell how often I have seen a private soldier escape the
horse, or a beggar wheedle out a good alms by a touch of the
brogue.&nbsp; And, indeed, as soon as the Albanian had laughed at
me I was pretty much at rest.&nbsp; Even then, however, he made
many conditions, and&mdash;for one thing&mdash;took away our
arms, before he suffered us aboard; which was the signal to cast
off; so that in a moment after, we were gliding down the bay with
a good breeze, and blessing the name of God for our
deliverance.&nbsp; Almost in the mouth of the estuary, we passed
the cruiser, and a little after the poor <i>Sarah</i> with her
prize crew; and these were both sights to make us tremble.&nbsp;
The Bermudan seemed a very safe place to be in, and our bold
stroke to have been fortunately played, when we were thus
reminded of the case of our companions.&nbsp; For all that, we
had only exchanged traps, jumped out of the frying-pan into the
fire, ran from the yard-arm to the block, and escaped the open
hostility of the man-of-war to lie at the mercy of the doubtful
faith of our Albanian merchant.</p>
<p>From many circumstances, it chanced we were safer than we
could have dared to hope.&nbsp; The town of Albany was at that
time much concerned in contraband trade across the desert with
the Indians and the French.&nbsp; This, as it was highly illegal,
relaxed their loyalty, and as it brought them in relation with
the politest people on the earth, divided even their
sympathies.&nbsp; In short, they were like all the smugglers in
the world, spies and agents ready-made for either party.&nbsp;
Our Albanian, besides, was a very honest man indeed, and very
greedy; and, to crown our luck, he conceived a great delight in
our society.&nbsp; Before we had reached the town of New York we
had come to a full agreement, that he should carry us as far as
Albany upon his ship, and thence put us on a way to pass the
boundaries and join the French.&nbsp; For all this we were to pay
at a high rate; but beggars cannot be choosers, nor outlaws
bargainers.</p>
<p>We sailed, then, up the Hudson River, which, I protest, is a
very fine stream, and put up at the &ldquo;King&rsquo;s
Arms&rdquo; in Albany.&nbsp; The town was full of the militia of
the province, breathing slaughter against the French.&nbsp;
Governor Clinton was there himself, a very busy man, and, by what
I could learn, very near distracted by the factiousness of his
Assembly.&nbsp; The Indians on both sides were on the war-path;
we saw parties of them bringing in prisoners and (what was much
worse) scalps, both male and female, for which they were paid at
a fixed rate; and I assure you the sight was not
encouraging.&nbsp; Altogether, we could scarce have come at a
period more unsuitable for our designs; our position in the chief
inn was dreadfully conspicuous; our Albanian fubbed us off with a
thousand delays, and seemed upon the point of a retreat from his
engagements; nothing but peril appeared to environ the poor
fugitives, and for some time we drowned our concern in a very
irregular course of living.</p>
<p>This, too, proved to be fortunate; and it&rsquo;s one of the
remarks that fall to be made upon our escape, how providentially
our steps were conducted to the very end.&nbsp; What a
humiliation to the dignity of man!&nbsp; My philosophy, the
extraordinary genius of Ballantrae, our valour, in which I grant
that we were equal&mdash;all these might have proved insufficient
without the Divine blessing on our efforts.&nbsp; And how true it
is, as the Church tells us, that the Truths of Religion are,
after all, quite applicable even to daily affairs!&nbsp; At
least, it was in the course of our revelry that we made the
acquaintance of a spirited youth by the name of Chew.&nbsp; He
was one of the most daring of the Indian traders, very well
acquainted with the secret paths of the wilderness, needy,
dissolute, and, by a last good fortune, in some disgrace with his
family.&nbsp; Him we persuaded to come to our relief; he
privately provided what was needful for our flight, and one day
we slipped out of Albany, without a word to our former friend,
and embarked, a little above, in a canoe.</p>
<p>To the toils and perils of this journey, it would require a
pen more elegant than mine to do full justice.&nbsp; The reader
must conceive for himself the dreadful wilderness which we had
now to thread; its thickets, swamps, precipitous rocks, impetuous
rivers, and amazing waterfalls.&nbsp; Among these barbarous
scenes we must toil all day, now paddling, now carrying our canoe
upon our shoulders; and at night we slept about a fire,
surrounded by the howling of wolves and other savage
animals.&nbsp; It was our design to mount the headwaters of the
Hudson, to the neighbourhood of Crown Point, where the French had
a strong place in the woods, upon Lake Champlain.&nbsp; But to
have done this directly were too perilous; and it was accordingly
gone upon by such a labyrinth of rivers, lakes, and portages as
makes my head giddy to remember.&nbsp; These paths were in
ordinary times entirely desert; but the country was now up, the
tribes on the war-path, the woods full of Indian scouts.&nbsp;
Again and again we came upon these parties when we least
expected, them; and one day, in particular, I shall never forget,
how, as dawn was coming in, we were suddenly surrounded by five
or six of these painted devils, uttering a very dreary sort of
cry, and brandishing their hatchets.&nbsp; It passed off
harmlessly, indeed, as did the rest of our encounters; for Chew
was well known and highly valued among the different
tribes.&nbsp; Indeed, he was a very gallant, respectable young
man; but even with the advantage of his companionship, you must
not think these meetings were without sensible peril.&nbsp; To
prove friendship on our part, it was needful to draw upon our
stock of rum&mdash;indeed, under whatever disguise, that is the
true business of the Indian trader, to keep a travelling
public-house in the forest; and when once the braves had got
their bottle of <i>scaura</i> (as they call this beastly liquor),
it behoved us to set forth and paddle for our scalps.&nbsp; Once
they were a little drunk, goodbye to any sense or decency; they
had but the one thought, to get more <i>scaura</i>.&nbsp; They
might easily take it in their heads to give us chase, and had we
been overtaken, I had never written these memoirs.</p>
<p>We were come to the most critical portion of our course, where
we might equally expect to fall into the hands of French or
English, when a terrible calamity befell us.&nbsp; Chew was taken
suddenly sick with symptoms like those of poison, and in the
course of a few hours expired in the bottom of the canoe.&nbsp;
We thus lost at once our guide, our interpreter, our boatman, and
our passport, for he was all these in one; and found ourselves
reduced, at a blow, to the most desperate and irremediable
distress.&nbsp; Chew, who took a great pride in his knowledge,
had indeed often lectured us on the geography; and Ballantrae, I
believe, would listen.&nbsp; But for my part I have always found
such information highly tedious; and beyond the fact that we were
now in the country of the Adirondack Indians, and not so distant
from our destination, could we but have found the way, I was
entirely ignorant.&nbsp; The wisdom of my course was soon the
more apparent; for with all his pains, Ballantrae was no further
advanced than myself.&nbsp; He knew we must continue to go up one
stream; then, by way of a portage, down another; and then up a
third.&nbsp; But you are to consider, in a mountain country, how
many streams come rolling in from every hand.&nbsp; And how is a
gentleman, who is a perfect stranger in that part of the world,
to tell any one of them from any other?&nbsp; Nor was this our
only trouble.&nbsp; We were great novices, besides, in handling a
canoe; the portages were almost beyond our strength, so that I
have seen us sit down in despair for half an hour at a time
without one word; and the appearance of a single Indian, since we
had now no means of speaking to them, would have been in all
probability the means of our destruction.&nbsp; There is
altogether some excuse if Ballantrae showed something of a
grooming disposition; his habit of imputing blame to others,
quite as capable as himself, was less tolerable, and his language
it was not always easy to accept.&nbsp; Indeed, he had contracted
on board the pirate ship a manner of address which was in a high
degree unusual between gentlemen; and now, when you might say he
was in a fever, it increased upon him hugely.</p>
<p>The third day of these wanderings, as we were carrying the
canoe upon a rocky portage, she fell, and was entirely
bilged.&nbsp; The portage was between two lakes, both pretty
extensive; the track, such as it was, opened at both ends upon
the water, and on both hands was enclosed by the unbroken woods;
and the sides of the lakes were quite impassable with bog: so
that we beheld ourselves not only condemned to go without our
boat and the greater part of our provisions, but to plunge at
once into impenetrable thickets and to desert what little
guidance we still had&mdash;the course of the river.&nbsp; Each
stuck his pistols in his belt, shouldered an axe, made a pack of
his treasure and as much food as he could stagger under; and
deserting the rest of our possessions, even to our swords, which
would have much embarrassed us among the woods, we set forth on
this deplorable adventure.&nbsp; The labours of Hercules, so
finely described by Homer, were a trifle to what we now
underwent.&nbsp; Some parts of the forest were perfectly dense
down to the ground, so that we must cut our way like mites in a
cheese.&nbsp; In some the bottom was full of deep swamp, and the
whole wood entirely rotten.&nbsp; I have leaped on a great fallen
log and sunk to the knees in touchwood; I have sought to stay
myself, in falling, against what looked to be a solid trunk, and
the whole thing has whiffed away at my touch like a sheet of
paper.&nbsp; Stumbling, falling, bogging to the knees, hewing our
way, our eyes almost put out with twigs and branches, our clothes
plucked from our bodies, we laboured all day, and it is doubtful
if we made two miles.&nbsp; What was worse, as we could rarely
get a view of the country, and were perpetually justled from our
path by obstacles, it was impossible even to have a guess in what
direction we were moving.</p>
<p>A little before sundown, in an open place with a stream, and
set about with barbarous mountains, Ballantrae threw down his
pack.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will go no further,&rdquo; said he, and bade
me light the fire, damning my blood in terms not proper for a
chairman.</p>
<p>I told him to try to forget he had ever been a pirate, and to
remember he had been a gentleman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you mad?&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
cross me here!&rdquo;&nbsp; And then, shaking his fist at the
hills, &ldquo;To think,&rdquo; cries he, &ldquo;that I must leave
my bones in this miserable wilderness!&nbsp; Would God I had died
upon the scaffold like a gentleman!&rdquo;&nbsp; This he said
ranting like an actor; and then sat biting his fingers and
staring on the ground, a most unchristian object.</p>
<p>I took a certain horror of the man, for I thought a soldier
and a gentleman should confront his end with more
philosophy.&nbsp; I made him no reply, therefore, in words; and
presently the evening fell so chill that I was glad, for my own
sake, to kindle a fire.&nbsp; And yet God knows, in such an open
spot, and the country alive with savages, the act was little
short of lunacy.&nbsp; Ballantrae seemed never to observe me; but
at last, as I was about parching a little corn, he looked up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you ever a brother?&rdquo; said be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the blessing of Heaven,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;not
less than five.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have the one,&rdquo; said he, with a strange voice;
and then presently, &ldquo;He shall pay me for all this,&rdquo;
he added.&nbsp; And when I asked him what was his brother&rsquo;s
part in our distress, &ldquo;What!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;he
sits in my place, he bears my name, he courts my wife; and I am
here alone with a damned Irishman in this tooth-chattering
desert!&nbsp; Oh, I have been a common gull!&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>The explosion was in all ways so foreign to my friend&rsquo;s
nature that I was daunted out of all my just
susceptibility.&nbsp; Sure, an offensive expression, however
vivacious, appears a wonderfully small affair in circumstances so
extreme!&nbsp; But here there is a strange thing to be
noted.&nbsp; He had only once before referred to the lady with
whom he was contracted.&nbsp; That was when we came in view of
the town of New York, when he had told me, if all had their
rights, he was now in sight of his own property, for Miss Graeme
enjoyed a large estate in the province.&nbsp; And this was
certainly a natural occasion; but now here she was named a second
time; and what is surely fit to be observed, in this very month,
which was November, &rsquo;47, and <i>I believe upon that very
day as we sat among these barbarous mountains</i>, his brother
and Miss Graeme were married.&nbsp; I am the least superstitious
of men; but the hand of Providence is here displayed too openly
not to be remarked. <a name="citation5"></a><a href="#footnote5"
class="citation">[5]</a></p>
<p>The next day, and the next, were passed in similar labours;
Ballantrae often deciding on our course by the spinning of a
coin; and once, when I expostulated on this childishness, he had
an odd remark that I have never forgotten.&nbsp; &ldquo;I know no
better way,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;to express my scorn of human
reason.&rdquo;&nbsp; I think it was the third day that we found
the body of a Christian, scalped and most abominably mangled, and
lying in a pudder of his blood; the birds of the desert screaming
over him, as thick as flies.&nbsp; I cannot describe how
dreadfully this sight affected us; but it robbed me of all
strength and all hope for this world.&nbsp; The same day, and
only a little after, we were scrambling over a part of the forest
that had been burned, when Ballantrae, who was a little ahead,
ducked suddenly behind a fallen trunk.&nbsp; I joined him in this
shelter, whence we could look abroad without being seen
ourselves; and in the bottom of the next vale, beheld a large war
party of the savages going by across our line.&nbsp; There might
be the value of a weak battalion present; all naked to the waist,
blacked with grease and soot, and painted with white lead and
vermilion, according to their beastly habits.&nbsp; They went one
behind another like a string of geese, and at a quickish trot; so
that they took but a little while to rattle by, and disappear
again among the woods.&nbsp; Yet I suppose we endured a greater
agony of hesitation and suspense in these few minutes than goes
usually to a man&rsquo;s whole life.&nbsp; Whether they were
French or English Indians, whether they desired scalps or
prisoners, whether we should declare ourselves upon the chance,
or lie quiet and continue the heart-breaking business of our
journey: sure, I think these were questions to have puzzled the
brains of Aristotle himself.&nbsp; Ballantrae turned to me with a
face all wrinkled up and his teeth showing in his mouth, like
what I have read of people starving; he said no word, but his
whole appearance was a kind of dreadful question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They may be of the English side,&rdquo; I whispered;
&ldquo;and think! the best we could then hope, is to begin this
over again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know&mdash;I know,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yet
it must come to a plunge at last.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he suddenly
plucked out his coin, shook it in his closed hands, looked at it,
and then lay down with his face in the dust.</p>
<p><i>Addition by Mr. Mackellar</i>.&mdash;I drop the
Chevalier&rsquo;s narration at this point because the couple
quarrelled and separated the same day; and the Chevalier&rsquo;s
account of the quarrel seems to me (I must confess) quite
incompatible with the nature of either of the men.&nbsp;
Henceforth they wandered alone, undergoing extraordinary
sufferings; until first one and then the other was picked up by a
party from Fort St. Frederick.&nbsp; Only two things are to be
noted.&nbsp; And first (as most important for my purpose) that
the Master, in the course of his miseries buried his treasure, at
a point never since discovered, but of which he took a drawing in
his own blood on the lining of his hat.&nbsp; And second, that on
his coming thus penniless to the Fort, he was welcomed like a
brother by the Chevalier, who thence paid his way to
France.&nbsp; The simplicity of Mr. Burke&rsquo;s character leads
him at this point to praise the Master exceedingly; to an eye
more worldly wise, it would seem it was the Chevalier alone that
was to be commended.&nbsp; I have the more pleasure in pointing
to this really very noble trait of my esteemed correspondent, as
I fear I may have wounded him immediately before.&nbsp; I have
refrained from comments on any of his extraordinary and (in my
eyes) immoral opinions, for I know him to be jealous of
respect.&nbsp; But his version of the quarrel is really more than
I can reproduce; for I knew the Master myself, and a man more
insusceptible of fear is not conceivable.&nbsp; I regret this
oversight of the Chevalier&rsquo;s, and all the more because the
tenor of his narrative (set aside a few flourishes) strikes me as
highly ingenuous.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV.&mdash;PERSECUTIONS ENDURED BY MR. HENRY.</h2>
<p>You can guess on what part of his adventures the Colonel
principally dwelled.&nbsp; Indeed, if we had heard it all, it is
to be thought the current of this business had been wholly
altered; but the pirate ship was very gently touched upon.&nbsp;
Nor did I hear the Colonel to an end even of that which he was
willing to disclose; for Mr. Henry, having for some while been
plunged in a brown study, rose at last from his seat and
(reminding the Colonel there were matters that he must attend to)
bade me follow him immediately to the office.</p>
<p>Once there, he sought no longer to dissemble his concern,
walking to and fro in the room with a contorted face, and passing
his hand repeatedly upon his brow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have some business,&rdquo; he began at last; and
there broke off, declared we must have wine, and sent for a
magnum of the best.&nbsp; This was extremely foreign to his
habitudes; and what was still more so, when the wine had come, he
gulped down one glass upon another like a man careless of
appearances.&nbsp; But the drink steadied him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will scarce be surprised, Mackellar,&rdquo; says
he, &ldquo;when I tell you that my brother&mdash;whose safety we
are all rejoiced to learn&mdash;stands in some need of
money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I told him I had misdoubted as much; but the time was not very
fortunate, as the stock was low.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not mine,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is the
money for the mortgage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I reminded him it was Mrs. Henry&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will be answerable to my wife,&rdquo; he cried
violently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;there is the
mortgage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;it is on that I would
consult you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I showed him how unfortunate a time it was to divert this
money from its destination; and how, by so doing, we must lose
the profit of our past economies, and plunge back the estate into
the mire.&nbsp; I even took the liberty to plead with him; and
when he still opposed me with a shake of the head and a bitter
dogged smile, my zeal quite carried me beyond my place.&nbsp;
&ldquo;This is midsummer madness,&rdquo; cried I; &ldquo;and I
for one will be no party to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You speak as though I did it for my pleasure,&rdquo;
says he.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I have a child now; and, besides, I
love order; and to say the honest truth, Mackellar, I had begun
to take a pride in the estates.&rdquo;&nbsp; He gloomed for a
moment.&nbsp; &ldquo;But what would you have?&rdquo; he went
on.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nothing is mine, nothing. This day&rsquo;s news
has knocked the bottom out of my life.&nbsp; I have only the name
and the shadow of things&mdash;only the shadow; there is no
substance in my rights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They will prove substantial enough before a
court,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>He looked at me with a burning eye, and seemed to repress the
word upon his lips; and I repented what I had said, for I saw
that while he spoke of the estate he had still a side-thought to
his marriage.&nbsp; And then, of a sudden, he twitched the letter
from his pocket, where it lay all crumpled, smoothed it violently
on the table, and read these words to me with a trembling tongue:
&ldquo;&lsquo;My dear Jacob&rsquo;&mdash;This is how he
begins!&rdquo; cries he&mdash;&ldquo;&lsquo;My dear Jacob, I once
called you so, you may remember; and you have now done the
business, and flung my heels as high as Criffel.&rsquo;&nbsp;
What do you think of that, Mackellar,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;from
an only brother?&nbsp; I declare to God I liked him very well; I
was always staunch to him; and this is how he writes!&nbsp; But I
will not sit down under the imputation&rdquo;&mdash;walking to
and fro&mdash;&ldquo;I am as good as he; I am a better man than
he, I call on God to prove it!&nbsp; I cannot give him all the
monstrous sum he asks; he knows the estate to be incompetent; but
I will give him what I have, and it in more than he
expects.&nbsp; I have borne all this too long.&nbsp; See what he
writes further on; read it for yourself: &lsquo;I know you are a
niggardly dog.&rsquo;&nbsp; A niggardly dog!&nbsp; I
niggardly?&nbsp; Is that true, Mackellar?&nbsp; You think it
is?&rdquo;&nbsp; I really thought he would have struck me at
that.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, you all think so!&nbsp; Well, you shall
see, and he shall see, and God shall see.&nbsp; If I ruin the
estate and go barefoot, I shall stuff this bloodsucker.&nbsp; Let
him ask all&mdash;all, and he shall have it!&nbsp; It is all his
by rights.&nbsp; Ah!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;and I foresaw all
this, and worse, when he would not let me go.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
poured out another glass of wine, and was about to carry it to
his lips, when I made so bold as to lay a finger on his
arm.&nbsp; He stopped a moment.&nbsp; &ldquo;You are
right,&rdquo; said he, and flung glass and all in the
fireplace.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come, let us count the money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I durst no longer oppose him; indeed, I was very much affected
by the sight of so much disorder in a man usually so controlled;
and we sat down together, counted the money, and made it up in
packets for the greater ease of Colonel Burke, who was to be the
bearer.&nbsp; This done, Mr. Henry returned to the hall, where he
and my old lord sat all night through with their guest.</p>
<p>A little before dawn I was called and set out with the
Colonel.&nbsp; He would scarce have liked a less responsible
convoy, for he was a man who valued himself; nor could we afford
him one more dignified, for Mr. Henry must not appear with the
freetraders.&nbsp; It was a very bitter morning of wind, and as
we went down through the long shrubbery the Colonel held himself
muffled in his cloak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;this is a great sum of money
that your friend requires.&nbsp; I must suppose his necessities
to be very great.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must suppose so,&rdquo; says he, I thought drily;
but perhaps it was the cloak about his mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am only a servant of the family,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You may deal openly with me.&nbsp; I think we are likely
to get little good by him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear man,&rdquo; said the Colonel, &ldquo;Ballantrae
is a gentleman of the most eminent natural abilities, and a man
that I admire, and that I revere, to the very ground he treads
on.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then he seemed to me to pause like one in a
difficulty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But for all that,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;we are likely
to get little good by him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, and you can have it your own way, my dear
man,&rdquo; says the Colonel.</p>
<p>By this time we had come to the side of the creek, where the
boat awaited him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said be, &ldquo;I am
sure I am very much your debtor for all your civility, Mr.
Whatever-your-name-is; and just as a last word, and since you
show so much intelligent interest, I will mention a small
circumstance that may be of use to the family.&nbsp; For I
believe my friend omitted to mention that he has the largest
pension on the Scots Fund of any refugee in Paris; and it&rsquo;s
the more disgraceful, sir,&rdquo; cries the Colonel, warming,
&ldquo;because there&rsquo;s not one dirty penny for
myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He cocked his hat at me, as if I had been to blame for this
partiality; then changed again into his usual swaggering
civility, shook me by the hand, and set off down to the boat,
with the money under his arms, and whistling as he went the
pathetic air of <i>Shule Aroon</i>.&nbsp; It was the first time I
had heard that tune; I was to hear it again, words and all, as
you shall learn, but I remember how that little stave of it ran
in my head after the freetraders had bade him &ldquo;Wheesht, in
the deil&rsquo;s name,&rdquo; and the grating of the oars had
taken its place, and I stood and watched the dawn creeping on the
sea, and the boat drawing away, and the lugger lying with her
foresail backed awaiting it.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The gap made in our money was a sore embarrassment, and, among
other consequences, it had this: that I must ride to Edinburgh,
and there raise a new loan on very questionable terms to keep the
old afloat; and was thus, for close upon three weeks, absent from
the house of Durrisdeer.</p>
<p>What passed in the interval I had none to tell me, but I found
Mrs. Henry, upon my return, much changed in her demeanour.&nbsp;
The old talks with my lord for the most part pretermitted; a
certain deprecation visible towards her husband, to whom I
thought she addressed herself more often; and, for one thing, she
was now greatly wrapped up in Miss Katharine.&nbsp; You would
think the change was agreeable to Mr. Henry; no such
matter!&nbsp; To the contrary, every circumstance of alteration
was a stab to him; he read in each the avowal of her truant
fancies.&nbsp; That constancy to the Master of which she was
proud while she supposed him dead, she had to blush for now she
knew he was alive, and these blushes were the hated spring of her
new conduct.&nbsp; I am to conceal no truth; and I will here say
plainly, I think this was the period in which Mr. Henry showed
the worst.&nbsp; He contained himself, indeed, in public; but
there was a deep-seated irritation visible underneath.&nbsp; With
me, from whom he had less concealment, he was often grossly
unjust, and even for his wife he would sometimes have a sharp
retort: perhaps when she had ruffled him with some unwonted
kindness; perhaps upon no tangible occasion, the mere habitual
tenor of the man&rsquo;s annoyance bursting spontaneously
forth.&nbsp; When he would thus forget himself (a thing so
strangely out of keeping with the terms of their relation), there
went a shook through the whole company, and the pair would look
upon each other in a kind of pained amazement.</p>
<p>All the time, too, while he was injuring himself by this
defect of temper, he was hurting his position by a silence, of
which I scarce know whether to say it was the child of generosity
or pride.&nbsp; The freetraders came again and again, bringing
messengers from the Master, and none departed empty-handed.&nbsp;
I never durst reason with Mr. Henry; he gave what was asked of
him in a kind of noble rage.&nbsp; Perhaps because he knew he was
by nature inclining to the parsimonious, he took a backforemost
pleasure in the recklessness with which he supplied his
brother&rsquo;s exigence.&nbsp; Perhaps the falsity of the
position would have spurred a humbler man into the same
excess.&nbsp; But the estate (if I may say so) groaned under it;
our daily expenses were shorn lower and lower; the stables were
emptied, all but four roadsters; servants were discharged, which
raised a dreadful murmuring in the country, and heated up the old
disfavour upon Mr. Henry; and at last the yearly visit to
Edinburgh must be discontinued.</p>
<p>This was in 1756.&nbsp; You are to suppose that for seven
years this bloodsucker had been drawing the life&rsquo;s blood
from Durrisdeer, and that all this time my patron had held his
peace.&nbsp; It was an effect of devilish malice in the Master
that he addressed Mr. Henry alone upon the matter of his demands,
and there was never a word to my lord.&nbsp; The family had
looked on, wondering at our economies.&nbsp; They had lamented, I
have no doubt, that my patron had become so great a miser&mdash;a
fault always despicable, but in the young abhorrent, and Mr.
Henry was not yet thirty years of age.&nbsp; Still, he had
managed the business of Durrisdeer almost from a boy; and they
bore with these changes in a silence as proud and bitter as his
own, until the coping-stone of the Edinburgh visit.</p>
<p>At this time I believe my patron and his wife were rarely
together, save at meals.&nbsp; Immediately on the back of Colonel
Burke&rsquo;s announcement Mrs. Henry made palpable advances; you
might say she had laid a sort of timid court to her husband,
different, indeed, from her former manner of unconcern and
distance.&nbsp; I never had the heart to blame Mr. Henry because
he recoiled from these advances; nor yet to censure the wife,
when she was cut to the quick by their rejection.&nbsp; But the
result was an entire estrangement, so that (as I say) they rarely
spoke, except at meals.&nbsp; Even the matter of the Edinburgh
visit was first broached at table, and it chanced that Mrs. Henry
was that day ailing and querulous.&nbsp; She had no sooner
understood her husband&rsquo;s meaning than the red flew in her
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At last,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;this is too
much!&nbsp; Heaven knows what pleasure I have in my life, that I
should be denied my only consolation.&nbsp; These shameful
proclivities must be trod down; we are already a mark and an
eyesore in the neighbourhood.&nbsp; I will not endure this fresh
insanity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot afford it,&rdquo; says Mr. Henry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Afford?&rdquo; she cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;For shame!&nbsp;
But I have money of my own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is all mine, madam, by marriage,&rdquo; he
snarled, and instantly left the room.</p>
<p>My old lord threw up his hands to Heaven, and he and his
daughter, withdrawing to the chimney, gave me a broad hint to be
gone.&nbsp; I found Mr. Henry in his usual retreat, the
steward&rsquo;s room, perched on the end of the table, and
plunging his penknife in it with a very ugly countenance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Henry,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you do yourself too
much injustice, and it is time this should cease.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cries he, &ldquo;nobody minds here.&nbsp;
They think it only natural.&nbsp; I have shameful
proclivities.&nbsp; I am a niggardly dog,&rdquo; and he drove his
knife up to the hilt.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I will show that
fellow,&rdquo; he cried with an oath, &ldquo;I will show him
which is the more generous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is no generosity,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;this is
only pride.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think I want morality?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>I thought he wanted help, and I should give it him,
willy-nilly; and no sooner was Mrs. Henry gone to her room than I
presented myself at her door and sought admittance.</p>
<p>She openly showed her wonder.&nbsp; &ldquo;What do you want
with me, Mr. Mackellar?&rdquo; said she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Lord knows, madam,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;I have
never troubled you before with any freedoms; but this thing lies
too hard upon my conscience, and it will out.&nbsp; Is it
possible that two people can be so blind as you and my lord? and
have lived all these years with a noble gentleman like Mr. Henry,
and understand so little of his nature?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does this mean?&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you not know where his money goes to? his&mdash;and
yours&mdash;and the money for the very wine he does not drink at
table?&rdquo; I went on.&nbsp; &ldquo;To Paris&mdash;to that
man!&nbsp; Eight thousand pounds has he had of us in seven years,
and my patron fool enough to keep it secret!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eight thousand pounds!&rdquo; she repeated.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It in impossible; the estate is not sufficient.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God knows how we have sweated farthings to produce
it,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;But eight thousand and sixty is
the sum, beside odd shillings.&nbsp; And if you can think my
patron miserly after that, this shall be my last
interference.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You need say no more, Mr. Mackellar,&rdquo; said
she.&nbsp; &ldquo;You have done most properly in what you too
modestly call your interference.&nbsp; I am much to blame; you
must think me indeed a very unobservant wife&rdquo; (looking upon
me with a strange smile), &ldquo;but I shall put this right at
once.&nbsp; The Master was always of a very thoughtless nature;
but his heart is excellent; he is the soul of generosity.&nbsp; I
shall write to him myself.&nbsp; You cannot think how you have
pained me by this communication.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, madam, I had hoped to have pleased you,&rdquo;
said I, for I raged to see her still thinking of the Master.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And pleased,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and pleased me of
course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That same day (I will not say but what I watched) I had the
satisfaction to see Mr. Henry come from his wife&rsquo;s room in
a state most unlike himself; for his face was all bloated with
weeping, and yet he seemed to me to walk upon the air.&nbsp; By
this, I was sure his wife had made him full amends for
once.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; thought I to myself, &ldquo;I have
done a brave stroke this day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the morrow, as I was seated at my books, Mr. Henry came in
softly behind me, took me by the shoulders, and shook me in a
manner of playfulness.&nbsp; &ldquo;I find you are a faithless
fellow after all,&rdquo; says he, which was his only reference to
my part; but the tone he spoke in was more to me than any
eloquence of protestation.&nbsp; Nor was this all I had effected;
for when the next messenger came (as he did not long afterwards)
from the Master, he got nothing away with him but a letter.&nbsp;
For some while back it had been I myself who had conducted these
affairs; Mr. Henry not setting pen to paper, and I only in the
dryest and most formal terms.&nbsp; But this letter I did not
even see; it would scarce be pleasant reading, for Mr. Henry felt
he had his wife behind him for once, and I observed, on the day
it was despatched, he had a very gratified expression.</p>
<p>Things went better now in the family, though it could scarce
be pretended they went well.&nbsp; There was now at least no
misconception; there was kindness upon all sides; and I believe
my patron and his wife might again have drawn together if he
could but have pocketed his pride, and she forgot (what was the
ground of all) her brooding on another man.&nbsp; It is wonderful
how a private thought leaks out; it is wonderful to me now how we
should all have followed the current of her sentiments; and
though she bore herself quietly, and had a very even disposition,
yet we should have known whenever her fancy ran to Paris.&nbsp;
And would not any one have thought that my disclosure must have
rooted up that idol?&nbsp; I think there is the devil in women:
all these years passed, never a sight of the man, little enough
kindness to remember (by all accounts) even while she had him,
the notion of his death intervening, his heartless rapacity laid
bare to her; that all should not do, and she must still keep the
best place in her heart for this accursed fellow, is a thing to
make a plain man rage.&nbsp; I had never much natural sympathy
for the passion of love; but this unreason in my patron&rsquo;s
wife disgusted me outright with the whole matter.&nbsp; I
remember checking a maid because she sang some bairnly kickshaw
while my mind was thus engaged; and my asperity brought about my
ears the enmity of all the petticoats about the house; of which I
reeked very little, but it amused Mr. Henry, who rallied me much
upon our joint unpopularity.&nbsp; It is strange enough (for my
own mother was certainly one of the salt of the earth, and my
Aunt Dickson, who paid my fees at the University, a very notable
woman), but I have never had much toleration for the female sex,
possibly not much understanding; and being far from a bold man, I
have ever shunned their company.&nbsp; Not only do I see no cause
to regret this diffidence in myself, but have invariably remarked
the most unhappy consequences follow those who were less
wise.&nbsp; So much I thought proper to set down, lest I show
myself unjust to Mrs. Henry.&nbsp; And, besides, the remark arose
naturally, on a re-perusal of the letter which was the next step
in these affairs, and reached me, to my sincere astonishment, by
a private hand, some week or so after the departure of the last
messenger.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right"><i>Letter from
Colonel</i> <span class="smcap">Burke</span> (<i>afterwards
Chevalier</i>) <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Mr.
Mackellar</span>.<br />
<span class="smcap">Troyes in Champagne</span>,<br />
<i>July</i> 12, 1756</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;You will
doubtless be surprised to receive a communication from one so
little known to you; but on the occasion I had the good fortune
to rencounter you at Durrisdeer, I remarked you for a young man
of a solid gravity of character: a qualification which I profess
I admire and revere next to natural genius or the bold chivalrous
spirit of the soldier.&nbsp; I was, besides, interested in the
noble family which you have the honour to serve, or (to speak
more by the book) to be the humble and respected friend of; and a
conversation I had the pleasure to have with you very early in
the morning has remained much upon my mind.</p>
<p>Being the other day in Paris, on a visit from this famous
city, where I am in garrison, I took occasion to inquire your
name (which I profess I had forgot) at my friend, the Master of
B.; and a fair opportunity occurring, I write to inform you of
what&rsquo;s new.</p>
<p>The Master of B. (when we had last some talk of him together)
was in receipt, as I think I then told you, of a highly
advantageous pension on the Scots Fund.&nbsp; He next received a
company, and was soon after advanced to a regiment of his
own.&nbsp; My dear sir, I do not offer to explain this
circumstance; any more than why I myself, who have rid at the
right hand of Princes, should be fubbed off with a pair of
colours and sent to rot in a hole at the bottom of the
province.&nbsp; Accustomed as I am to Courts, I cannot but feel
it is no atmosphere for a plain soldier; and I could never hope
to advance by similar means, even could I stoop to the
endeavour.&nbsp; But our friend has a particular aptitude to
succeed by the means of ladies; and if all be true that I have
heard, he enjoyed a remarkable protection.&nbsp; It is like this
turned against him; for when I had the honour to shake him by the
hand, he was but newly released from the Bastille, where he had
been cast on a sealed letter; and, though now released, has both
lost his regiment and his pension.&nbsp; My dear sir, the loyalty
of a plain Irishman will ultimately succeed in the place of
craft; as I am sure a gentleman of your probity will agree.</p>
<p>Now, sir, the Master is a man whose genius I admire beyond
expression, and, besides, he is my friend; but I thought a little
word of this revolution in his fortunes would not come amiss,
for, in my opinion, the man&rsquo;s desperate.&nbsp; He spoke,
when I saw him, of a trip to India (whither I am myself in some
hope of accompanying my illustrious countryman, Mr. Lally); but
for this he would require (as I understood) more money than was
readily at his command.&nbsp; You may have heard a military
proverb: that it is a good thing to make a bridge of gold to a
flying enemy?&nbsp; I trust you will take my meaning and I
subscribe myself, with proper respects to my Lord Durrisdeer, to
his son, and to the beauteous Mrs. Durie,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">My dear Sir,<br />
Your obedient humble servant,<br />
<span class="smcap">Francis Burke</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This missive I carried at once to Mr. Henry; and I think there
was but the one thought between the two of us: that it had come a
week too late.&nbsp; I made haste to send an answer to Colonel
Burke, in which I begged him, if he should see the Master, to
assure him his next messenger would be attended to.&nbsp; But
with all my haste I was not in time to avert what was impending;
the arrow had been drawn, it must now fly.&nbsp; I could almost
doubt the power of Providence (and certainly His will) to stay
the issue of events; and it is a strange thought, how many of us
had been storing up the elements of this catastrophe, for how
long a time, and with how blind an ignorance of what we did.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>From the coming of the Colonel&rsquo;s letter, I had a
spyglass in my room, began to drop questions to the tenant folk,
and as there was no great secrecy observed, and the freetrade (in
our part) went by force as much as stealth, I had soon got
together a knowledge of the signals in use, and knew pretty well
to an hour when any messenger might be expected.&nbsp; I say, I
questioned the tenants; for with the traders themselves,
desperate blades that went habitually armed, I could never bring
myself to meddle willingly.&nbsp; Indeed, by what proved in the
sequel an unhappy chance, I was an object of scorn to some of
these braggadocios; who had not only gratified me with a
nickname, but catching me one night upon a by-path, and being all
(as they would have said) somewhat merry, had caused me to dance
for their diversion.&nbsp; The method employed was that of
cruelly chipping at my toes with naked cutlasses, shouting at the
same time &ldquo;Square-Toes&rdquo;; and though they did me no
bodily mischief, I was none the less deplorably affected, and was
indeed for several days confined to my bed: a scandal on the
state of Scotland on which no comment is required.</p>
<p>It happened on the afternoon of November 7th, in this same
unfortunate year, that I espied, during my walk, the smoke of a
beacon fire upon the Muckleross.&nbsp; It was drawing near time
for my return; but the uneasiness upon my spirits was that day so
great that I must burst through the thickets to the edge of what
they call the Craig Head.&nbsp; The sun was already down, but
there was still a broad light in the west, which showed me some
of the smugglers treading out their signal fire upon the Ross,
and in the bay the lugger lying with her sails brailed up.&nbsp;
She was plainly but new come to anchor, and yet the skiff was
already lowered and pulling for the landing-place at the end of
the long shrubbery.&nbsp; And this I knew could signify but one
thing, the coming of a messenger for Durrisdeer.</p>
<p>I laid aside the remainder of my terrors, clambered down the
brae&mdash;a place I had never ventured through before, and was
hid among the shore-side thickets in time to see the boat
touch.&nbsp; Captain Crail himself was steering, a thing not
usual; by his side there sat a passenger; and the men gave way
with difficulty, being hampered with near upon half a dozen
portmanteaus, great and small.&nbsp; But the business of landing
was briskly carried through; and presently the baggage was all
tumbled on shore, the boat on its return voyage to the lugger,
and the passenger standing alone upon the point of rock, a tall
slender figure of a gentleman, habited in black, with a sword by
his side and a walking-cane upon his wrist.&nbsp; As he so stood,
he waved the cane to Captain Crail by way of salutation, with
something both of grace and mockery that wrote the gesture deeply
on my mind.</p>
<p>No sooner was the boat away with my sworn enemies than I took
a sort of half courage, came forth to the margin of the thicket,
and there halted again, my mind being greatly pulled about
between natural diffidence and a dark foreboding of the
truth.&nbsp; Indeed, I might have stood there swithering all
night, had not the stranger turned, spied me through the mists,
which were beginning to fall, and waved and cried on me to draw
near.&nbsp; I did so with a heart like lead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, my good man,&rdquo; said he, in the English
accent, &ldquo;there are some things for Durrisdeer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was now near enough to see him, a very handsome figure and
countenance, swarthy, lean, long, with a quick, alert, black
look, as of one who was a fighter, and accustomed to command;
upon one cheek he had a mole, not unbecoming; a large diamond
sparkled on his hand; his clothes, although of the one hue, were
of a French and foppish design; his ruffles, which he wore longer
than common, of exquisite lace; and I wondered the more to see
him in such a guise when he was but newly landed from a dirty
smuggling lugger.&nbsp; At the same time he had a better look at
me, toised me a second time sharply, and then smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wager, my friend,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;that I know
both your name and your nickname.&nbsp; I divined these very
clothes upon your hand of writing, Mr. Mackellar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At these words I fell to shaking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;you need not be afraid of
me.&nbsp; I bear no malice for your tedious letters; and it is my
purpose to employ you a good deal.&nbsp; You may call me Mr.
Bally: it is the name I have assumed; or rather (since I am
addressing so great a precision) it is so I have curtailed my
own.&nbsp; Come now, pick up that and
that&rdquo;&mdash;indicating two of the portmanteaus.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That will be as much as you are fit to bear, and the rest
can very well wait.&nbsp; Come, lose no more time, if you
please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His tone was so cutting that I managed to do as he bid by a
sort of instinct, my mind being all the time quite lost.&nbsp; No
sooner had I picked up the portmanteaus than he turned his back
and marched off through the long shrubbery, where it began
already to be dusk, for the wood is thick and evergreen.&nbsp; I
followed behind, loaded almost to the dust, though I profess I
was not conscious of the burthen; being swallowed up in the
monstrosity of this return, and my mind flying like a
weaver&rsquo;s shuttle.</p>
<p>On a sudden I set the portmanteaus to the ground and
halted.&nbsp; He turned and looked back at me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are the Master of Ballantrae?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will do me the justice to observe,&rdquo; says he,
&ldquo;I have made no secret with the astute
Mackellar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And in the name of God,&rdquo; cries I, &ldquo;what
brings you here?&nbsp; Go back, while it is yet time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thank you,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your master
has chosen this way, and not I; but since he has made the choice,
he (and you also) must abide by the result.&nbsp; And now pick up
these things of mine, which you have set down in a very boggy
place, and attend to that which I have made your
business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But I had no thought now of obedience; I came straight up to
him.&nbsp; &ldquo;If nothing will move you to go back,&rdquo;
said I; &ldquo;though, sure, under all the circumstances, any
Christian or even any gentleman would scruple to go forward . . .
&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These are gratifying expressions,&rdquo; he threw
in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If nothing will move you to go back,&rdquo; I
continued, &ldquo;there are still some decencies to be
observed.&nbsp; Wait here with your baggage, and I will go
forward and prepare your family.&nbsp; Your father is an old man;
and . . . &rdquo; I stumbled . . . &ldquo;there are decencies to
be observed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Truly,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;this Mackellar improves
upon acquaintance.&nbsp; But look you here, my man, and
understand it once for all&mdash;you waste your breath upon me,
and I go my own way with inevitable motion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; says I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is that so?&nbsp; We
shall see then!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And I turned and took to my heels for Durrisdeer.&nbsp; He
clutched at me and cried out angrily, and then I believe I heard
him laugh, and then I am certain he pursued me for a step or two,
and (I suppose) desisted.&nbsp; One thing at least is sure, that
I came but a few minutes later to the door of the great house,
nearly strangled for the lack of breath, but quite alone.&nbsp;
Straight up the stair I ran, and burst into the hall, and stopped
before the family without the power of speech; but I must have
carried my story in my looks, for they rose out of their places
and stared on me like changelings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has come,&rdquo; I panted out at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He?&rdquo; said Mr. Henry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Himself,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My son?&rdquo; cried my lord.&nbsp; &ldquo;Imprudent,
imprudent boy!&nbsp; Oh, could he not stay where he was
safe!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Never a word says Mrs. Henry; nor did I look at her, I scarce
knew why.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mr. Henry, with a very deep breath,
&ldquo;and where is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I left him in the long shrubbery,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take me to him,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>So we went out together, he and I, without another word from
any one; and in the midst of the gravelled plot encountered the
Master strolling up, whistling as he came, and beating the air
with his cane.&nbsp; There was still light enough overhead to
recognise, though not to read, a countenance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! Jacob,&rdquo; says the Master.&nbsp; &ldquo;So here
is Esau back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;James,&rdquo; says Mr. Henry, &ldquo;for God&rsquo;s
sake, call me by my name.&nbsp; I will not pretend that I am glad
to see you; but I would fain make you as welcome as I can in the
house of our fathers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or in <i>my</i> house? or <i>yours</i>?&rdquo; says the
Master.&nbsp; &ldquo;Which were you about to say?&nbsp; But this
is an old sore, and we need not rub it.&nbsp; If you would not
share with me in Paris, I hope you will yet scarce deny your
elder brother a corner of the fire at Durrisdeer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is very idle speech,&rdquo; replied Mr.
Henry.&nbsp; &ldquo;And you understand the power of your position
excellently well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I believe I do,&rdquo; said the other with a
little laugh.&nbsp; And this, though they had never touched
hands, was (as we may say) the end of the brothers&rsquo;
meeting; for at this the Master turned to me and bade me fetch
his baggage.</p>
<p>I, on my side, turned to Mr. Henry for a confirmation; perhaps
with some defiance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As long as the Master is here, Mr. Mackellar, you will
very much oblige me by regarding his wishes as you would my
own,&rdquo; says Mr. Henry.&nbsp; &ldquo;We are constantly
troubling you: will you be so good as send one of the
servants?&rdquo;&mdash;with an accent on the word.</p>
<p>If this speech were anything at all, it was surely a
well-deserved reproof upon the stranger; and yet, so devilish was
his impudence, he twisted it the other way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And shall we be common enough to say &lsquo;Sneck
up&rsquo;?&rdquo; inquires he softly, looking upon me
sideways.</p>
<p>Had a kingdom depended on the act, I could not have trusted
myself in words; even to call a servant was beyond me; I had
rather serve the man myself than speak; and I turned away in
silence and went into the long shrubbery, with a heart full of
anger and despair.&nbsp; It was dark under the trees, and I
walked before me and forgot what business I was come upon, till I
near broke my shin on the portmanteaus.&nbsp; Then it was that I
remarked a strange particular; for whereas I had before carried
both and scarce observed it, it was now as much as I could do to
manage one.&nbsp; And this, as it forced me to make two journeys,
kept me the longer from the hall.</p>
<p>When I got there, the business of welcome was over long ago;
the company was already at supper; and by an oversight that cut
me to the quick, my place had been forgotten.&nbsp; I had seen
one side of the Master&rsquo;s return; now I was to see the
other.&nbsp; It was he who first remarked my coming in and
standing back (as I did) in some annoyance.&nbsp; He jumped from
his seat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if I have not got the good Mackellar&rsquo;s
place!&rdquo; cries he.&nbsp; &ldquo;John, lay another for Mr.
Bally; I protest he will disturb no one, and your table is big
enough for all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I could scarce credit my ears, nor yet my senses, when he took
me by the shoulders and thrust me, laughing, into my own
place&mdash;such an affectionate playfulness was in his
voice.&nbsp; And while John laid the fresh place for him (a thing
on which he still insisted), he went and leaned on his
father&rsquo;s chair and looked down upon him, and the old man
turned about and looked upwards on his son, with such a pleasant
mutual tenderness that I could have carried my hand to my head in
mere amazement.</p>
<p>Yet all was of a piece.&nbsp; Never a harsh word fell from
him, never a sneer showed upon his lip.&nbsp; He had laid aside
even his cutting English accent, and spoke with the kindly
Scots&rsquo; tongue, that set a value on affectionate words; and
though his manners had a graceful elegance mighty foreign to our
ways in Durrisdeer, it was still a homely courtliness, that did
not shame but flattered us.&nbsp; All that, he did throughout the
meal, indeed, drinking wine with me with a notable respect,
turning about for a pleasant word with John, fondling his
father&rsquo;s hand, breaking into little merry tales of his
adventures, calling up the past with happy reference&mdash;all he
did was so becoming, and himself so handsome, that I could scarce
wonder if my lord and Mrs. Henry sat about the board with radiant
faces, or if John waited behind with dropping tears.</p>
<p>As soon as supper was over, Mrs. Henry rose to withdraw.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This was never your way, Alison,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is my way now,&rdquo; she replied: which was
notoriously false, &ldquo;and I will give you a good-night,
James, and a welcome&mdash;from the dead,&rdquo; said she, and
her voice dropped and trembled.</p>
<p>Poor Mr. Henry, who had made rather a heavy figure through the
meal, was more concerned than ever; pleased to see his wife
withdraw, and yet half displeased, as he thought upon the cause
of it; and the next moment altogether dashed by the fervour of
her speech.</p>
<p>On my part, I thought I was now one too many; and was stealing
after Mrs. Henry, when the Master saw me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Mr. Mackellar,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;I take this
near on an unfriendliness.&nbsp; I cannot have you go: this is to
make a stranger of the prodigal son; and let me remind you
where&mdash;in his own father&rsquo;s house!&nbsp; Come, sit ye
down, and drink another glass with Mr. Bally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay, Mr. Mackellar,&rdquo; says my lord, &ldquo;we
must not make a stranger either of him or you.&nbsp; I have been
telling my son,&rdquo; he added, his voice brightening as usual
on the word, &ldquo;how much we valued all your friendly
service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So I sat there, silent, till my usual hour; and might have
been almost deceived in the man&rsquo;s nature but for one
passage, in which his perfidy appeared too plain.&nbsp; Here was
the passage; of which, after what he knows of the brothers&rsquo;
meeting, the reader shall consider for himself.&nbsp; Mr. Henry
sitting somewhat dully, in spite of his best endeavours to carry
things before my lord, up jumps the Master, passes about the
board, and claps his brother on the shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, come, <i>Hairry lad</i>,&rdquo; says he, with a
broad accent such as they must have used together when they were
boys, &ldquo;you must not be downcast because your brother has
come home.&nbsp; All&rsquo;s yours, that&rsquo;s sure enough, and
little I grudge it you.&nbsp; Neither must you grudge me my place
beside my father&rsquo;s fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that is too true, Henry,&rdquo; says my old lord
with a little frown, a thing rare with him.&nbsp; &ldquo;You have
been the elder brother of the parable in the good sense; you must
be careful of the other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am easily put in the wrong,&rdquo; said Mr.
Henry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who puts you in the wrong?&rdquo; cried my lord, I
thought very tartly for so mild a man.&nbsp; &ldquo;You have
earned my gratitude and your brother&rsquo;s many thousand times:
you may count on its endurance; and let that suffice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, Harry, that you may,&rdquo; said the Master; and I
thought Mr. Henry looked at him with a kind of wildness in his
eye.</p>
<p>On all the miserable business that now followed, I have four
questions that I asked myself often at the time and ask myself
still:&mdash;Was the man moved by a particular sentiment against
Mr. Henry? or by what he thought to be his interest? or by a mere
delight in cruelty such as cats display and theologians tell us
of the devil? or by what he would have called love?&nbsp; My
common opinion halts among the three first; but perhaps there lay
at the spring of his behaviour an element of all.&nbsp; As
thus:&mdash;Animosity to Mr. Henry would explain his hateful
usage of him when they were alone; the interests he came to serve
would explain his very different attitude before my lord; that
and some spice of a design of gallantry, his care to stand well
with Mrs. Henry; and the pleasure of malice for itself, the pains
he was continually at to mingle and oppose these lines of
conduct.</p>
<p>Partly because I was a very open friend to my patron, partly
because in my letters to Paris I had often given myself some
freedom of remonstrance, I was included in his diabolical
amusement.&nbsp; When I was alone with him, he pursued me with
sneers; before the family he used me with the extreme of friendly
condescension.&nbsp; This was not only painful in itself; not
only did it put me continually in the wrong; but there was in it
an element of insult indescribable.&nbsp; That he should thus
leave me out in his dissimulation, as though even my testimony
were too despicable to be considered, galled me to the
blood.&nbsp; But what it was to me is not worth notice.&nbsp; I
make but memorandum of it here; and chiefly for this reason, that
it had one good result, and gave me the quicker sense of Mr.
Henry&rsquo;s martyrdom.</p>
<p>It was on him the burthen fell.&nbsp; How was he to respond to
the public advances of one who never lost a chance of gibing him
in private?&nbsp; How was he to smile back on the deceiver and
the insulter?&nbsp; He was condemned to seem ungracious.&nbsp; He
was condemned to silence.&nbsp; Had he been less proud, had he
spoken, who would have credited the truth?&nbsp; The acted
calumny had done its work; my lord and Mrs. Henry were the daily
witnesses of what went on; they could have sworn in court that
the Master was a model of long-suffering good-nature, and Mr.
Henry a pattern of jealousy and thanklessness.&nbsp; And ugly
enough as these must have appeared in any one, they seemed
tenfold uglier in Mr. Henry; for who could forget that the Master
lay in peril of his life, and that he had already lost his
mistress, his title, and his fortune?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Henry, will you ride with me?&rdquo; asks the Master
one day.</p>
<p>And Mr. Henry, who had been goaded by the man all morning,
raps out: &ldquo;I will not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sometimes wish you would be kinder, Henry,&rdquo;
says the other, wistfully.</p>
<p>I give this for a specimen; but such scenes befell
continually.&nbsp; Small wonder if Mr. Henry was blamed; small
wonder if I fretted myself into something near upon a bilious
fever; nay, and at the mere recollection feel a bitterness in my
blood.</p>
<p>Sure, never in this world was a more diabolical contrivance:
so perfidious, so simple, so impossible to combat.&nbsp; And yet
I think again, and I think always, Mrs. Henry might have road
between the lines; she might have had more knowledge of her
husband&rsquo;s nature; after all these years of marriage she
might have commanded or captured his confidence.&nbsp; And my old
lord, too&mdash;that very watchful gentleman&mdash;where was all
his observation?&nbsp; But, for one thing, the deceit was
practised by a master hand, and might have gulled an angel.&nbsp;
For another (in the case of Mrs. Henry), I have observed there
are no persons so far away as those who are both married and
estranged, so that they seem out of ear-shot or to have no common
tongue.&nbsp; For a third (in the case of both of these
spectators), they were blinded by old ingrained
predilection.&nbsp; And for a fourth, the risk the Master was
supposed to stand in (supposed, I say&mdash;you will soon hear
why) made it seem the more ungenerous to criticise; and, keeping
them in a perpetual tender solicitude about his life, blinded
them the more effectually to his faults.</p>
<p>It was during this time that I perceived most clearly the
effect of manner, and was led to lament most deeply the plainness
of my own.&nbsp; Mr. Henry had the essence of a gentleman; when
he was moved, when there was any call of circumstance, he could
play his part with dignity and spirit; but in the day&rsquo;s
commerce (it is idle to deny it) he fell short of the
ornamental.&nbsp; The Master (on the other hand) had never a
movement but it commanded him.&nbsp; So it befell that when the
one appeared gracious and the other ungracious, every trick of
their bodies seemed to call out confirmation.&nbsp; Not that
alone: but the more deeply Mr. Henry floundered in his
brother&rsquo;s toils, the more clownish he grew; and the more
the Master enjoyed his spiteful entertainment, the more
engagingly, the more smilingly, he went!&nbsp; So that the plot,
by its own scope and progress, furthered and confirmed
itself.</p>
<p>It was one of the man&rsquo;s arts to use the peril in which
(as I say) he was supposed to stand.&nbsp; He spoke of it to
those who loved him with a gentle pleasantry, which made it the
more touching.&nbsp; To Mr. Henry he used it as a cruel weapon of
offence.&nbsp; I remember his laying his finger on the clean
lozenge of the painted window one day when we three were alone
together in the hall.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here went your lucky guinea,
Jacob,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; And when Mr. Henry only looked upon
him darkly, &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;you need not look
such impotent malice, my good fly.&nbsp; You can be rid of your
spider when you please.&nbsp; How long, O Lord?&nbsp; When are
you to be wrought to the point of a denunciation, scrupulous
brother?&nbsp; It is one of my interests in this dreary
hole.&nbsp; I ever loved experiment.&rdquo;&nbsp; Still Mr. Henry
only stared upon him with a grooming brow, and a changed colour;
and at last the Master broke out in a laugh and clapped him on
the shoulder, calling him a sulky dog.&nbsp; At this my patron
leaped back with a gesture I thought very dangerous; and I must
suppose the Master thought so too, for he looked the least in the
world discountenance, and I do not remember him again to have
laid hands on Mr. Henry.</p>
<p>But though he had his peril always on his lips in the one way
or the other, I thought his conduct strangely incautious, and
began to fancy the Government&mdash;who had set a price upon his
head&mdash;was gone sound asleep.&nbsp; I will not deny I was
tempted with the wish to denounce him; but two thoughts withheld
me: one, that if he were thus to end his life upon an honourable
scaffold, the man would be canonised for good in the minds of his
father and my patron&rsquo;s wife; the other, that if I was
anyway mingled in the matter, Mr. Henry himself would scarce
escape some glancings of suspicion.&nbsp; And in the meanwhile
our enemy went in and out more than I could have thought
possible, the fact that he was home again was buzzed about all
the country-side, and yet he was never stirred.&nbsp; Of all
these so-many and so-different persons who were acquainted with
his presence, none had the least greed&mdash;as I used to say in
my annoyance&mdash;or the least loyalty; and the man rode here
and there&mdash;fully more welcome, considering the lees of old
unpopularity, than Mr. Henry&mdash;and considering the
freetraders, far safer than myself.</p>
<p>Not but what he had a trouble of his own; and this, as it
brought about the gravest consequences, I must now relate.&nbsp;
The reader will scarce have forgotten Jessie Broun; her way of
life was much among the smuggling party; Captain Crail himself
was of her intimates; and she had early word of Mr. Bally&rsquo;s
presence at the house.&nbsp; In my opinion, she had long ceased
to care two straws for the Master&rsquo;s person; but it was
become her habit to connect herself continually with the
Master&rsquo;s name; that was the ground of all her play-acting;
and so now, when he was back, she thought she owed it to herself
to grow a haunter of the neighbourhood of Durrisdeer.&nbsp; The
Master could scarce go abroad but she was there in wait for him;
a scandalous figure of a woman, not often sober; hailing him
wildly as &ldquo;her bonny laddie,&rdquo; quoting pedlar&rsquo;s
poetry, and, as I receive the story, even seeking to weep upon
his neck.&nbsp; I own I rubbed my hands over this persecution;
but the Master, who laid so much upon others, was himself the
least patient of men.&nbsp; There were strange scenes enacted in
the policies.&nbsp; Some say he took his cane to her, and Jessie
fell back upon her former weapons&mdash;stones.&nbsp; It is
certain at least that he made a motion to Captain Crail to have
the woman trepanned, and that the Captain refused the proposition
with uncommon vehemence.&nbsp; And the end of the matter was
victory for Jessie.&nbsp; Money was got together; an interview
took place, in which my proud gentleman must consent to be kissed
and wept upon; and the woman was set up in a public of her own,
somewhere on Solway side (but I forget where), and, by the only
news I ever had of it, extremely ill-frequented.</p>
<p>This is to look forward.&nbsp; After Jessie had been but a
little while upon his heels, the Master comes to me one day in
the steward&rsquo;s office, and with more civility than usual,
&ldquo;Mackellar,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;there is a damned crazy
wench comes about here.&nbsp; I cannot well move in the matter
myself, which brings me to you.&nbsp; Be so good as to see to it:
the men must have a strict injunction to drive the wench
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said I, trembling a little, &ldquo;you can
do your own dirty errands for yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said not a word to that, and left the room.</p>
<p>Presently came Mr. Henry.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here is news!&rdquo;
cried he.&nbsp; &ldquo;It seems all is not enough, and you must
add to my wretchedness.&nbsp; It seems you have insulted Mr.
Bally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Under your kind favour, Mr. Henry,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;it was he that insulted me, and, as I think,
grossly.&nbsp; But I may have been careless of your position when
I spoke; and if you think so when you know all, my dear patron,
you have but to say the word.&nbsp; For you I would obey in any
point whatever, even to sin, God pardon me!&rdquo;&nbsp; And
thereupon I told him what had passed.</p>
<p>Mr. Henry smiled to himself; a grimmer smile I never
witnessed.&nbsp; &ldquo;You did exactly well,&rdquo; said
he.&nbsp; &ldquo;He shall drink his Jessie Broun to the
dregs.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then, spying the Master outside, he
opened the window, and crying to him by the name of Mr. Bally,
asked him to step up and have a word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;James,&rdquo; said he, when our persecutor had come in
and closed the door behind him, looking at me with a smile, as if
he thought I was to be humbled, &ldquo;you brought me a complaint
against Mr. Mackellar, into which I have inquired.&nbsp; I need
not tell you I would always take his word against yours; for we
are alone, and I am going to use something of your own
freedom.&nbsp; Mr. Mackellar is a gentleman I value; and you must
contrive, so long as you are under this roof, to bring yourself
into no more collisions with one whom I will support at any
possible cost to me or mine.&nbsp; As for the errand upon which
you came to him, you must deliver yourself from the consequences
of your own cruelty, and, none of my servants shall be at all
employed in such a case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father&rsquo;s servants, I believe,&rdquo; says the
Master.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go to him with this tale,&rdquo; said Mr. Henry.</p>
<p>The Master grew very white.&nbsp; He pointed at me with his
finger.&nbsp; &ldquo;I want that man discharged,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He shall not be,&rdquo; said Mr. Henry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall pay pretty dear for this,&rdquo; says the
Master.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have paid so dear already for a wicked
brother,&rdquo; said Mr. Henry, &ldquo;that I am bankrupt even of
fears.&nbsp; You have no place left where you can strike
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will show you about that,&rdquo; says the Master, and
went softly away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will he do next, Mackellar?&rdquo; cries Mr.
Henry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me go away,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;My dear
patron, let me go away; I am but the beginning of fresh
sorrows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you leave me quite alone?&rdquo; said he.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>We were not long in suspense as to the nature of the new
assault.&nbsp; Up to that hour the Master had played a very close
game with Mrs. Henry; avoiding pointedly to be alone with her,
which I took at the time for an effect of decency, but now think
to be a most insidious art; meeting her, you may say, at
meal-time only; and behaving, when he did so, like an
affectionate brother.&nbsp; Up to that hour, you may say he had
scarce directly interfered between Mr. Henry and his wife; except
in so far as he had manoeuvred the one quite forth from the good
graces of the other.&nbsp; Now all that was to be changed; but
whether really in revenge, or because he was wearying of
Durrisdeer and looked about for some diversion, who but the devil
shall decide?</p>
<p>From that hour, at least, began the siege of Mrs. Henry; a
thing so deftly carried on that I scarce know if she was aware of
it herself, and that her husband must look on in silence.&nbsp;
The first parallel was opened (as was made to appear) by
accident.&nbsp; The talk fell, as it did often, on the exiles in
France; so it glided to the matter of their songs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is one,&rdquo; says the Master, &ldquo;if you are
curious in these matters, that has always seemed to me very
moving.&nbsp; The poetry is harsh; and yet, perhaps because of my
situation, it has always found the way to my heart.&nbsp; It is
supposed to be sung, I should tell you, by an exile&rsquo;s
sweetheart; and represents perhaps, not so much the truth of what
she is thinking, as the truth of what he hopes of her, poor soul!
in these far lands.&rdquo;&nbsp; And here the Master sighed,
&ldquo;I protest it is a pathetic sight when a score of rough
Irish, all common sentinels, get to this song; and you may see,
by their falling tears, how it strikes home to them.&nbsp; It
goes thus, father,&rdquo; says he, very adroitly taking my lord
for his listener, &ldquo;and if I cannot get to the end of it,
you must think it is a common case with us exiles.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And thereupon he struck up the same air as I had heard the
Colonel whistle; but now to words, rustic indeed, yet most
pathetically setting forth a poor girl&rsquo;s aspirations for an
exiled lover; of which one verse indeed (or something like it)
still sticks by me:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>O, I will dye my petticoat red,<br />
With my dear boy I&rsquo;ll beg my bread,<br />
Though all my friends should wish me dead,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For Willie among the rushes, O!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He sang it well, even as a song; but he did better yet a
performer.&nbsp; I have heard famous actors, when there was not a
dry eye in the Edinburgh theatre; a great wonder to behold; but
no more wonderful than how the Master played upon that little
ballad, and on those who heard him, like an instrument, and
seemed now upon the point of failing, and now to conquer his
distress, so that words and music seemed to pour out of his own
heart and his own past, and to be aimed directly at Mrs.
Henry.&nbsp; And his art went further yet; for all was so
delicately touched, it seemed impossible to suspect him of the
least design; and so far from making a parade of emotion, you
would have sworn he was striving to be calm.&nbsp; When it came
to an end, we all sat silent for a time; he had chosen the dusk
of the afternoon, so that none could see his neighbour&rsquo;s
face; but it seemed as if we held our breathing; only my old lord
cleared his throat.&nbsp; The first to move was the singer, who
got to his feet suddenly and softly, and went and walked softly
to and fro in the low end of the hall, Mr. Henry&rsquo;s
customary place.&nbsp; We were to suppose that he there struggled
down the last of his emotion; for he presently returned and
launched into a disquisition on the nature of the Irish (always
so much miscalled, and whom he defended) in his natural voice; so
that, before the lights were brought, we were in the usual course
of talk.&nbsp; But even then, methought Mrs. Henry&rsquo;s face
was a shade pale; and, for another thing, she withdrew almost at
once.</p>
<p>The next sign was a friendship this insidious devil struck up
with innocent Miss Katharine; so that they were always together,
hand in hand, or she climbing on his knee, like a pair of
children.&nbsp; Like all his diabolical acts, this cut in several
ways.&nbsp; It was the last stroke to Mr. Henry, to see his own
babe debauched against him; it made him harsh with the poor
innocent, which brought him still a peg lower in his wife&rsquo;s
esteem; and (to conclude) it was a bond of union between the lady
and the Master.&nbsp; Under this influence, their old reserve
melted by daily stages.&nbsp; Presently there came walks in the
long shrubbery, talks in the Belvedere, and I know not what
tender familiarity.&nbsp; I am sure Mrs. Henry was like many a
good woman; she had a whole conscience but perhaps by the means
of a little winking.&nbsp; For even to so dull an observer as
myself, it was plain her kindness was of a more moving nature
than the sisterly.&nbsp; The tones of her voice appeared more
numerous; she had a light and softness in her eye; she was more
gentle with all of us, even with Mr. Henry, even with myself;
methought she breathed of some quiet melancholy happiness.</p>
<p>To look on at this, what a torment it was for Mr. Henry!&nbsp;
And yet it brought our ultimate deliverance, as I am soon to
tell.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The purport of the Master&rsquo;s stay was no more noble (gild
it as they might) than to wring money out.&nbsp; He had some
design of a fortune in the French Indies, as the Chevalier wrote
me; and it was the sum required for this that he came
seeking.&nbsp; For the rest of the family it spelled ruin; but my
lord, in his incredible partiality, pushed ever for the
granting.&nbsp; The family was now so narrowed down (indeed,
there were no more of them than just the father and the two sons)
that it was possible to break the entail and alienate a piece of
land.&nbsp; And to this, at first by hints, and then by open
pressure, Mr. Henry was brought to consent.&nbsp; He never would
have done so, I am very well assured, but for the weight of the
distress under which he laboured.&nbsp; But for his passionate
eagerness to see his brother gone, he would not thus have broken
with his own sentiment and the traditions of his house.&nbsp; And
even so, he sold them his consent at a dear rate, speaking for
once openly, and holding the business up in its own shameful
colours.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will observe,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;this is an
injustice to my son, if ever I have one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that you are not likely to have,&rdquo; said my
lord.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God knows!&rdquo; says Mr. Henry.&nbsp; &ldquo;And
considering the cruel falseness of the position in which I stand
to my brother, and that you, my lord, are my father, and have the
right to command me, I set my hand to this paper.&nbsp; But one
thing I will say first: I have been ungenerously pushed, and when
next, my lord, you are tempted to compare your sons, I call on
you to remember what I have done and what he has done.&nbsp; Acts
are the fair test.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My lord was the most uneasy man I ever saw; even in his old
face the blood came up.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think this is not a very
wisely chosen moment, Henry, for complaints,&rdquo; said
he.&nbsp; &ldquo;This takes away from the merit of your
generosity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not deceive yourself, my lord,&rdquo; said Mr.
Henry.&nbsp; &ldquo;This injustice is not done from generosity to
him, but in obedience to yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before strangers . . . &rdquo; begins my lord, still
more unhappily affected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no one but Mackellar here,&rdquo; said Mr.
Henry; &ldquo;he is my friend.&nbsp; And, my lord, as you make
him no stranger to your frequent blame, it were hard if I must
keep him one to a thing so rare as my defence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Almost I believe my lord would have rescinded his decision;
but the Master was on the watch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&nbsp; Henry, Henry,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;you are
the best of us still.&nbsp; Rugged and true!&nbsp; Ah! man, I
wish I was as good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And at that instance of his favourite&rsquo;s generosity my
lord desisted from his hesitation, and the deed was signed.</p>
<p>As soon as it could he brought about, the land of Ochterhall
was sold for much below its value, and the money paid over to our
leech and sent by some private carriage into France.&nbsp; Or so
he said; though I have suspected since it did not go so
far.&nbsp; And now here was all the man&rsquo;s business brought
to a successful head, and his pockets once more bulging with our
gold; and yet the point for which we had consented to this
sacrifice was still denied us, and the visitor still lingered on
at Durrisdeer.&nbsp; Whether in malice, or because the time was
not yet come for his adventure to the Indies, or because he had
hopes of his design on Mrs. Henry, or from the orders of the
Government, who shall say? but linger he did, and that for
weeks.</p>
<p>You will observe I say: from the orders of Government; for
about this time the man&rsquo;s disreputable secret trickled
out.</p>
<p>The first hint I had was from a tenant, who commented on the
Master&rsquo;s stay, and yet more on his security; for this
tenant was a Jacobitish sympathiser, and had lost a son at
Culloden, which gave him the more critical eye.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There is one thing,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that I cannot
but think strange; and that is how he got to
Cockermouth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To Cockermouth?&rdquo; said I, with a sudden memory of
my first wonder on beholding the man disembark so point-de-vice
after so long a voyage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; says the tenant, &ldquo;it was there
he was picked up by Captain Crail.&nbsp; You thought he had come
from France by sea?&nbsp; And so we all did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I turned this news a little in my head, and then carried it to
Mr. Henry.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here is an odd circumstance,&rdquo; said
I, and told him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What matters how he came, Mackellar, so long as he is
here?&rdquo; groans Mr. Henry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but think again!&nbsp;
Does not this smack a little of some Government connivance?&nbsp;
You know how much we have wondered already at the man&rsquo;s
security.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop,&rdquo; said Mr. Henry.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let me think
of this.&rdquo;&nbsp; And as he thought, there came that grim
smile upon his face that was a little like the
Master&rsquo;s.&nbsp; &ldquo;Give me paper,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp;
And he sat without another word and wrote to a gentleman of his
acquaintance&mdash;I will name no unnecessary names, but he was
one in a high place.&nbsp; This letter I despatched by the only
hand I could depend upon in such a
case&mdash;Macconochie&rsquo;s; and the old man rode hard, for he
was back with the reply before even my eagerness had ventured to
expect him.&nbsp; Again, as he read it, Mr. Henry had the same
grim smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the best you have done for me yet,
Mackellar,&rdquo; says he.&nbsp; &ldquo;With this in my hand I
will give him a shog.&nbsp; Watch for us at dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At dinner accordingly Mr. Henry proposed some very public
appearance for the Master; and my lord, as he had hoped, objected
to the danger of the course.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; says Mr. Henry, very easily, &ldquo;you need
no longer keep this up with me.&nbsp; I am as much in the secret
as yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the secret?&rdquo; says my lord.&nbsp; &ldquo;What
do you mean, Henry?&nbsp; I give you my word, I am in no secret
from which you are excluded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Master had changed countenance, and I saw he was struck in
a joint of his harness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; says Mr. Henry, turning to him with a huge
appearance of surprise.&nbsp; &ldquo;I see you serve your masters
very faithfully; but I had thought you would have been humane
enough to set your father&rsquo;s mind at rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you talking of?&nbsp; I refuse to have my
business publicly discussed.&nbsp; I order this to cease,&rdquo;
cries the Master very foolishly and passionately, and indeed more
like a child than a man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So much discretion was not looked for at your hands, I
can assure you,&rdquo; continued Mr. Henry.&nbsp; &ldquo;For see
what my correspondent writes&rdquo;&mdash;unfolding the
paper&mdash;&ldquo;&lsquo;It is, of course, in the interests both
of the Government and the gentleman whom we may perhaps best
continue to call Mr. Bally, to keep this understanding secret;
but it was never meant his own family should continue to endure
the suspense you paint so feelingly; and I am pleased mine should
be the hand to set these fears at rest.&nbsp; Mr. Bally is as
safe in Great Britain as yourself.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this possible?&rdquo; cries my lord, looking at his
son, with a great deal of wonder and still more of suspicion in
his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear father,&rdquo; says the Master, already much
recovered.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am overjoyed that this may be
disclosed.&nbsp; My own instructions, direct from London, bore a
very contrary sense, and I was charged to keep the indulgence
secret from every one, yourself not excepted, and indeed yourself
expressly named&mdash;as I can show in black and white unless I
have destroyed the letter.&nbsp; They must have changed their
mind very swiftly, for the whole matter is still quite fresh; or
rather, Henry&rsquo;s correspondent must have misconceived that
part, as he seems to have misconceived the rest.&nbsp; To tell
you the truth, sir,&rdquo; he continued, getting visibly more
easy, &ldquo;I had supposed this unexplained favour to a rebel
was the effect of some application from yourself; and the
injunction to secrecy among my family the result of a desire on
your part to conceal your kindness.&nbsp; Hence I was the more
careful to obey orders.&nbsp; It remains now to guess by what
other channel indulgence can have flowed on so notorious an
offender as myself; for I do not think your son need defend
himself from what seems hinted at in Henry&rsquo;s letter.&nbsp;
I have never yet heard of a Durrisdeer who was a turncoat or a
spy,&rdquo; says he, proudly.</p>
<p>And so it seemed he had swum out of this danger unharmed; but
this was to reckon without a blunder he had made, and without the
pertinacity of Mr. Henry, who was now to show he had something of
his brother&rsquo;s spirit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say the matter is still fresh,&rdquo; says Mr.
Henry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is recent,&rdquo; says the Master, with a fair show
of stoutness and yet not without a quaver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it so recent as that?&rdquo; asks Mr. Henry, like a
man a little puzzled, and spreading his letter forth again.</p>
<p>In all the letter there was no word as to the date; but how
was the Master to know that?</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seemed to come late enough for me,&rdquo; says he,
with a laugh.&nbsp; And at the sound of that laugh, which rang
false, like a cracked bell, my lord looked at him again across
the table, and I saw his old lips draw together close.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Mr. Henry, still glancing on his
letter, &ldquo;but I remember your expression.&nbsp; You said it
was very fresh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And here we had a proof of our victory, and the strongest
instance yet of my lord&rsquo;s incredible indulgence; for what
must he do but interfere to save his favourite from exposure!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think, Henry,&rdquo; says he, with a kind of pitiful
eagerness, &ldquo;I think we need dispute no more.&nbsp; We are
all rejoiced at last to find your brother safe; we are all at one
on that; and, as grateful subjects, we can do no less than drink
to the king&rsquo;s health and bounty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus was the Master extricated; but at least he had been put
to his defence, he had come lamely out, and the attraction of his
personal danger was now publicly plucked away from him.&nbsp; My
lord, in his heart of hearts, now knew his favourite to be a
Government spy; and Mrs. Henry (however she explained the tale)
was notably cold in her behaviour to the discredited hero of
romance.&nbsp; Thus in the best fabric of duplicity, there is
some weak point, if you can strike it, which will loosen all; and
if, by this fortunate stroke, we had not shaken the idol, who can
say how it might have gone with us at the catastrophe?</p>
<p>And yet at the time we seemed to have accomplished
nothing.&nbsp; Before a day or two he had wiped off the
ill-results of his discomfiture, and, to all appearance, stood as
high as ever.&nbsp; As for my Lord Durrisdeer, he was sunk in
parental partiality; it was not so much love, which should be an
active quality, as an apathy and torpor of his other powers; and
forgiveness (so to mis-apply a noble word) flowed from him in
sheer weakness, like the tears of senility.&nbsp; Mrs.
Henry&rsquo;s was a different case; and Heaven alone knows what
he found to say to her, or how he persuaded her from her
contempt.&nbsp; It is one of the worst things of sentiment, that
the voice grows to be more important than the words, and the
speaker than that which is spoken.&nbsp; But some excuse the
Master must have found, or perhaps he had even struck upon some
art to wrest this exposure to his own advantage; for after a time
of coldness, it seemed as if things went worse than ever between
him and Mrs. Henry.&nbsp; They were then constantly
together.&nbsp; I would not be thought to cut one shadow of
blame, beyond what is due to a half-wilful blindness, on that
unfortunate lady; but I do think, in these last days, she was
playing very near the fire; and whether I be wrong or not in
that, one thing is sure and quite sufficient: Mr. Henry thought
so.&nbsp; The poor gentleman sat for days in my room, so great a
picture of distress that I could never venture to address him;
yet it is to be thought he found some comfort even in my presence
and the knowledge of my sympathy.&nbsp; There were times, too,
when we talked, and a strange manner of talk it was; there was
never a person named, nor an individual circumstance referred to;
yet we had the same matter in our minds, and we were each aware
of it.&nbsp; It is a strange art that can thus be practised; to
talk for hours of a thing, and never name nor yet so much as hint
at it.&nbsp; And I remember I wondered if it was by some such
natural skill that the Master made love to Mrs. Henry all day
long (as he manifestly did), yet never startled her into
reserve.</p>
<p>To show how far affairs had gone with Mr. Henry, I will give
some words of his, uttered (as I have cause not to forget) upon
the 26th of February, 1757.&nbsp; It was unseasonable weather, a
cast back into Winter: windless, bitter cold, the world all white
with rime, the sky low and gray: the sea black and silent like a
quarry-hole.&nbsp; Mr. Henry sat close by the fire, and debated
(as was now common with him) whether &ldquo;a man&rdquo; should
&ldquo;do things,&rdquo; whether &ldquo;interference was
wise,&rdquo; and the like general propositions, which each of us
particularly applied.&nbsp; I was by the window, looking out,
when there passed below me the Master, Mrs. Henry, and Miss
Katharine, that now constant trio.&nbsp; The child was running to
and fro, delighted with the frost; the Master spoke close in the
lady&rsquo;s ear with what seemed (even from so far) a devilish
grace of insinuation; and she on her part looked on the ground
like a person lost in listening.&nbsp; I broke out of my
reserve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I were you, Mr. Henry,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I would
deal openly with my lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mackellar, Mackellar,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you do not
see the weakness of my ground.&nbsp; I can carry no such base
thoughts to any one&mdash;to my father least of all; that would
be to fall into the bottom of his scorn.&nbsp; The weakness of my
ground,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;lies in myself, that I am not
one who engages love.&nbsp; I have their gratitude, they all tell
me that; I have a rich estate of it!&nbsp; But I am not present
in their minds; they are moved neither to think with me nor to
think for me.&nbsp; There is my loss!&rdquo;&nbsp; He got to his
feet, and trod down the fire.&nbsp; &ldquo;But some method must
be found, Mackellar,&rdquo; said he, looking at me suddenly over
his shoulder; &ldquo;some way must be found.&nbsp; I am a man of
a great deal of patience&mdash;far too much&mdash;far too
much.&nbsp; I begin to despise myself.&nbsp; And yet, sure, never
was a man involved in such a toil!&rdquo;&nbsp; He fell back to
his brooding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cheer up,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;It will burst of
itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am far past anger now,&rdquo; says he, which had so
little coherency with my own observation that I let both
fall.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER V.&mdash;ACCOUNT OF ALL THAT PASSED ON THE NIGHT ON
FEBRUARY 27TH, 1757.</h2>
<p>On the evening of the interview referred to, the Master went
abroad; he was abroad a great deal of the next day also, that
fatal 27th; but where he went, or what he did, we never concerned
ourselves to ask until next day.&nbsp; If we had done so, and by
any chance found out, it might have changed all.&nbsp; But as all
we did was done in ignorance, and should be so judged, I shall so
narrate these passages as they appeared to us in the moment of
their birth, and reserve all that I since discovered for the time
of its discovery.&nbsp; For I have now come to one of the dark
parts of my narrative, and must engage the reader&rsquo;s
indulgence for my patron.</p>
<p>All the 27th that rigorous weather endured: a stifling cold;
the folk passing about like smoking chimneys; the wide hearth in
the hall piled high with fuel; some of the spring birds that had
already blundered north into our neighbourhood, besieging the
windows of the house or trotting on the frozen turf like things
distracted.&nbsp; About noon there came a blink of sunshine,
showing a very pretty, wintry, frosty landscape of white hills
and woods, with Crail&rsquo;s lugger waiting for a wind under the
Craig Head, and the smoke mounting straight into the air from
every farm and cottage.&nbsp; With the coming of night, the haze
closed in overhead; it fell dark and still and starless, and
exceeding cold: a night the most unseasonable, fit for strange
events.</p>
<p>Mrs. Henry withdrew, as was now her custom, very early.&nbsp;
We had set ourselves of late to pass the evening with a game of
cards; another mark that our visitor was wearying mightily of the
life at Durrisdeer; and we had not been long at this when my old
lord slipped from his place beside the fire, and was off without
a word to seek the warmth of bed.&nbsp; The three thus left
together had neither love nor courtesy to share; not one of us
would have sat up one instant to oblige another; yet from the
influence of custom, and as the cards had just been dealt, we
continued the form of playing out the round.&nbsp; I should say
we were late sitters; and though my lord had departed earlier
than was his custom, twelve was already gone some time upon the
clock, and the servants long ago in bed.&nbsp; Another thing I
should say, that although I never saw the Master anyway affected
with liquor, he had been drinking freely, and was perhaps
(although he showed it not) a trifle heated.</p>
<p>Anyway, he now practised one of his transitions; and so soon
as the door closed behind my lord, and without the smallest
change of voice, shifted from ordinary civil talk into a stream
of insult.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Henry, it is yours to play,&rdquo; he had been
saying, and now continued: &ldquo;It is a very strange thing how,
even in so small a matter as a game of cards, you display your
rusticity.&nbsp; You play, Jacob, like a bonnet laird, or a
sailor in a tavern.&nbsp; The same dulness, the same petty greed,
<i>cette lenteur d&rsquo;heb&eacute;t&eacute; qui me fait
rager</i>; it is strange I should have such a brother.&nbsp; Even
Square-toes has a certain vivacity when his stake is imperilled;
but the dreariness of a game with you I positively lack language
to depict.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Henry continued to look at his cards, as though very
maturely considering some play; but his mind was elsewhere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear God, will this never be done?&rdquo; cries the
Master.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Quel lourdeau</i>!&nbsp; But why do I
trouble you with French expressions, which are lost on such an
ignoramus?&nbsp; A <i>lourdeau</i>, my dear brother, is as we
might say a bumpkin, a clown, a clodpole: a fellow without grace,
lightness, quickness; any gift of pleasing, any natural
brilliancy: such a one as you shall see, when you desire, by
looking in the mirror.&nbsp; I tell you these things for your
good, I assure you; and besides, Square-toes&rdquo; (looking at
me and stifling a yawn), &ldquo;it is one of my diversions in
this very dreary spot to toast you and your master at the fire
like chestnuts.&nbsp; I have great pleasure in your case, for I
observe the nickname (rustic as it is) has always the power to
make you writhe.&nbsp; But sometimes I have more trouble with
this dear fellow here, who seems to have gone to sleep upon his
cards.&nbsp; Do you not see the applicability of the epithet I
have just explained, dear Henry?&nbsp; Let me show you.&nbsp; For
instance, with all those solid qualities which I delight to
recognise in you, I never knew a woman who did not prefer
me&mdash;nor, I think,&rdquo; he continued, with the most silken
deliberation, &ldquo;I think&mdash;who did not continue to prefer
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Henry laid down his cards.&nbsp; He rose to his feet very
softly, and seemed all the while like a person in deep
thought.&nbsp; &ldquo;You coward!&rdquo; he said gently, as if to
himself.&nbsp; And then, with neither hurry nor any particular
violence, he struck the Master in the mouth.</p>
<p>The Master sprang to his feet like one transfigured; I had
never seen the man so beautiful.&nbsp; &ldquo;A blow!&rdquo; he
cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;I would not take a blow from God
Almighty!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lower your voice,&rdquo; said Mr. Henry.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Do you wish my father to interfere for you
again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen, gentlemen,&rdquo; I cried, and sought to
come between them.</p>
<p>The Master caught me by the shoulder, held me at arm&rsquo;s
length, and still addressing his brother: &ldquo;Do you know what
this means?&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was the most deliberate act of my life,&rdquo; says
Mr. Henry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must have blood, I must have blood for this,&rdquo;
says the Master.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please God it shall be yours,&rdquo; said Mr. Henry;
and he went to the wall and took down a pair of swords that hung
there with others, naked.&nbsp; These he presented to the Master
by the points.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mackellar shall see us play
fair,&rdquo; said Mr. Henry.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think it very
needful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You need insult me no more,&rdquo; said the Master,
taking one of the swords at random.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have hated you
all my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father is but newly gone to bed,&rdquo; said Mr.
Henry.&nbsp; &ldquo;We must go somewhere forth of the
house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is an excellent place in the long
shrubbery,&rdquo; said the Master.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;shame upon you
both!&nbsp; Sons of the same mother, would you turn against the
life she gave you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even so, Mackellar,&rdquo; said Mr. Henry, with the
same perfect quietude of manner he had shown throughout.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is what I will prevent,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>And now here is a blot upon my life.&nbsp; At these words of
mine the Master turned his blade against my bosom; I saw the
light run along the steel; and I threw up my arms and fell to my
knees before him on the floor.&nbsp; &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; I
cried, like a baby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall have no more trouble with him,&rdquo; said the
Master.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is a good thing to have a coward in the
house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must have light,&rdquo; said Mr. Henry, as though
there had been no interruption.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This trembler can bring a pair of candles,&rdquo; said
the Master.</p>
<p>To my shame be it said, I was still so blinded with the
flashing of that bare sword that I volunteered to bring a
lantern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We do not need a l-l-lantern,&rdquo; says the Master,
mocking me.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is no breath of air.&nbsp; Come,
get to your feet, take a pair of lights, and go before.&nbsp; I
am close behind with this&mdash;&rdquo; making. the blade glitter
as he spoke.</p>
<p>I took up the candlesticks and went before them, steps that I
would give my hand to recall; but a coward is a slave at the
best; and even as I went, my teeth smote each other in my
mouth.&nbsp; It was as he had said: there was no breath stirring;
a windless stricture of frost had bound the air; and as we went
forth in the shine of the candles, the blackness was like a roof
over our heads.&nbsp; Never a word was said; there was never a
sound but the creaking of our steps along the frozen path.&nbsp;
The cold of the night fell about me like a bucket of water; I
shook as I went with more than terror; but my companions,
bare-headed like myself, and fresh from the warm ball, appeared
not even conscious of the change.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is the place,&rdquo; said the Master.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Set down the candles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I did as he bid me, and presently the flames went up, as
steady as in a chamber, in the midst of the frosted trees, and I
beheld these two brothers take their places.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The light is something in my eyes,&rdquo; said the
Master.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will give you every advantage,&rdquo; replied Mr.
Henry, shifting his ground, &ldquo;for I think you are about to
die.&rdquo;&nbsp; He spoke rather sadly than otherwise, yet there
was a ring in his voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Henry Durie,&rdquo; said the Master, &ldquo;two words
before I begin.&nbsp; You are a fencer, you can hold a foil; you
little know what a change it makes to hold a sword!&nbsp; And by
that I know you are to fall.&nbsp; But see how strong is my
situation!&nbsp; If you fall, I shift out of this country to
where my money is before me.&nbsp; If I fall, where are
you?&nbsp; My father, your wife&mdash;who is in love with me, as
you very well know&mdash;your child even, who prefers me to
yourself:&mdash;how will these avenge me!&nbsp; Had you thought
of that, dear Henry?&rdquo;&nbsp; He looked at his brother with a
smile; then made a fencing-room salute.</p>
<p>Never a word said Mr. Henry, but saluted too, and the swords
rang together.</p>
<p>I am no judge of the play; my head, besides, was gone with
cold and fear and horror; but it seems that Mr. Henry took and
kept the upper hand from the engagement, crowding in upon his foe
with a contained and glowing fury.&nbsp; Nearer and nearer he
crept upon the man, till of a sudden the Master leaped back with
a little sobbing oath; and I believe the movement brought the
light once more against his eyes.&nbsp; To it they went again, on
the fresh ground; but now methought closer, Mr. Henry pressing
more outrageously, the Master beyond doubt with shaken
confidence.&nbsp; For it is beyond doubt he now recognised
himself for lost, and had some taste of the cold agony of fear;
or he had never attempted the foul stroke.&nbsp; I cannot say I
followed it, my untrained eye was never quick enough to seize
details, but it appears he caught his brother&rsquo;s blade with
his left hand, a practice not permitted.&nbsp; Certainly Mr.
Henry only saved himself by leaping on one side; as certainly the
Master, lunging in the air, stumbled on his knee, and before he
could move the sword was through his body.</p>
<p>I cried out with a stifled scream, and ran in; but the body
was already fallen to the ground, where it writhed a moment like
a trodden worm, and then lay motionless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at his left hand,&rdquo; said Mr. Henry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is all bloody,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the inside?&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is cut on the inside,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought so,&rdquo; said he, and turned his back.</p>
<p>I opened the man&rsquo;s clothes; the heart was quite still,
it gave not a flutter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God forgive us, Mr. Henry!&rdquo; said I.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He is dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dead?&rdquo; he repeated, a little stupidly; and then
with a rising tone, &ldquo;Dead? dead?&rdquo; says he, and
suddenly cast his bloody sword upon the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What must we do?&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Be
yourself, sir.&nbsp; It is too late now: you must be
yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned and stared at me.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, Mackellar!&rdquo;
says he, and put his face in his hands.</p>
<p>I plucked him by the coat.&nbsp; &ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake,
for all our sakes, be more courageous!&rdquo; said I.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What must we do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He showed me his face with the same stupid stare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do?&rdquo; says he.&nbsp;&nbsp; And with that his eye
fell on the body, and &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; he cries out, with his
hand to his brow, as if he had never remembered; and, turning
from me, made off towards the house of Durrisdeer at a strange
stumbling run.</p>
<p>I stood a moment mused; then it seemed to me my duty lay most
plain on the side of the living; and I ran after him, leaving the
candles on the frosty ground and the body lying in their light
under the trees.&nbsp; But run as I pleased, he had the start of
me, and was got into the house, and up to the hall, where I found
him standing before the fire with his face once more in his
hands, and as he so stood he visibly shuddered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Henry, Mr. Henry,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;this will
be the ruin of us all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is this that I have done?&rdquo; cries he, and
then looking upon me with a countenance that I shall never
forget, &ldquo;Who is to tell the old man?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The word knocked at my heart; but it was no time for
weakness.&nbsp; I went and poured him out a glass of
brandy.&nbsp; &ldquo;Drink that,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;drink it
down.&rdquo;&nbsp; I forced him to swallow it like a child; and,
being still perished with the cold of the night, I followed his
example.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has to be told, Mackellar,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It must be told.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he fell suddenly in a
seat&mdash;my old lord&rsquo;s seat by the chimney-side&mdash;and
was shaken with dry sobs.</p>
<p>Dismay came upon my soul; it was plain there was no help in
Mr. Henry.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;sit there,
and leave all to me.&rdquo;&nbsp; And taking a candle in my hand,
I set forth out of the room in the dark house.&nbsp; There was no
movement; I must suppose that all had gone unobserved; and I was
now to consider how to smuggle through the rest with the like
secrecy.&nbsp; It was no hour for scruples; and I opened my
lady&rsquo;s door without so much as a knock, and passed boldly
in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is some calamity happened,&rdquo; she cried,
sitting up in bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I will go forth again into
the passage; and do you get as quickly as you can into your
clothes.&nbsp; There is much to be done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She troubled me with no questions, nor did she keep me
waiting.&nbsp; Ere I had time to prepare a word of that which I
must say to her, she was on the threshold signing me to
enter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;if you cannot be very
brave, I must go elsewhere; for if no one helps me to-night,
there is an end of the house of Durrisdeer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am very courageous,&rdquo; said she; and she looked
at me with a sort of smile, very painful to see, but very brave
too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has come to a duel,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A duel?&rdquo; she repeated.&nbsp; &ldquo;A duel!&nbsp;
Henry and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the Master,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Things have
been borne so long, things of which you know nothing, which you
would not believe if I should tell.&nbsp; But to-night it went
too far, and when he insulted you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop,&rdquo; said she.&nbsp; &ldquo;He?&nbsp;
Who?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! madam,&rdquo; cried I, my bitterness breaking
forth, &ldquo;do you ask me such a question?&nbsp; Indeed, then,
I may go elsewhere for help; there is none here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know in what I have offended you,&rdquo; said
she.&nbsp; &ldquo;Forgive me; put me out of this
suspense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But I dared not tell her yet; I felt not sure of her; and at
the doubt, and under the sense of impotence it brought with it, I
turned on the poor woman with something near to anger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;we are speaking of two
men: one of them insulted you, and you ask me which.&nbsp; I will
help you to the answer.&nbsp; With one of these men you have
spent all your hours: has the other reproached you?&nbsp; To one
you have been always kind; to the other, as God sees me and
judges between us two, I think not always: has his love ever
failed you?&nbsp; To-night one of these two men told the other,
in my hearing&mdash;the hearing of a hired stranger,&mdash;that
you were in love with him.&nbsp; Before I say one word, you shall
answer your own question: Which was it?&nbsp; Nay, madam, you
shall answer me another: If it has come to this dreadful end,
whose fault is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stared at me like one dazzled.&nbsp; &ldquo;Good
God!&rdquo; she said once, in a kind of bursting exclamation; and
then a second time in a whisper to herself: &ldquo;Great
God!&mdash;In the name of mercy, Mackellar, what is wrong?&rdquo;
she cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am made up; I can hear all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are not fit to hear,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Whatever it was, you shall say first it was your
fault.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she cried, with a gesture of wringing her
hands, &ldquo;this man will drive me mad!&nbsp; Can you not put
me out of your thoughts?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think not once of you,&rdquo; I cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
think of none but my dear unhappy master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she cried, with her hand to her heart,
&ldquo;is Henry dead?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lower your voice,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I saw her sway like something stricken by the wind; and I know
not whether in cowardice or misery, turned aside and looked upon
the floor.&nbsp; &ldquo;These are dreadful tidings,&rdquo; said I
at length, when her silence began to put me in some fear;
&ldquo;and you and I behove to be the more bold if the house is
to be saved.&rdquo;&nbsp; Still she answered nothing.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There is Miss Katharine, besides,&rdquo; I added:
&ldquo;unless we bring this matter through, her inheritance is
like to be of shame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I do not know if it was the thought of her child or the naked
word shame, that gave her deliverance; at least, I had no sooner
spoken than a sound passed her lips, the like of it I never
heard; it was as though she had lain buried under a hill and
sought to move that burthen.&nbsp; And the next moment she had
found a sort of voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a fight,&rdquo; she whispered.&nbsp; &ldquo;It
was not&mdash;&rdquo; and she paused upon the word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a fair fight on my dear master&rsquo;s
part,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;As for the other, he was slain
in the very act of a foul stroke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not now!&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;hatred of that man glows
in my bosom like a burning fire; ay, even now he is dead.&nbsp;
God knows, I would have stopped the fighting, had I dared.&nbsp;
It is my shame I did not.&nbsp; But when I saw him fall, if I
could have spared one thought from pitying of my master, it had
been to exult in that deliverance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I do not know if she marked; but her next words were,
&ldquo;My lord?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That shall be my part,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will not speak to him as you have to me?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;have you not some one else
to think of?&nbsp; Leave my lord to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some one else?&rdquo; she repeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your husband,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; She looked at me
with a countenance illegible.&nbsp; &ldquo;Are you going to turn
your back on him?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>Still she looked at me; then her hand went to her heart
again.&nbsp; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God bless you for that word!&rdquo; I said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Go to him now, where he sits in the hall; speak to
him&mdash;it matters not what you say; give him your hand; say,
&lsquo;I know all;&rsquo;&mdash;if God gives you grace enough,
say, &lsquo;Forgive me.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God strengthen you, and make you merciful,&rdquo; said
she.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will go to my husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me light you there,&rdquo; said I, taking up the
candle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will find my way in the dark,&rdquo; she said, with a
shudder, and I think the shudder was at me.</p>
<p>So we separated&mdash;she down stairs to where a little light
glimmered in the hall-door, I along the passage to my
lord&rsquo;s room.&nbsp; It seems hard to say why, but I could
not burst in on the old man as I could on the young woman; with
whatever reluctance, I must knock.&nbsp; But his old slumbers
were light, or perhaps he slept not; and at the first summons I
was bidden enter.</p>
<p>He, too, sat up in bed; very aged and bloodless he looked; and
whereas he had a certain largeness of appearance when dressed for
daylight, he now seemed frail and little, and his face (the wig
being laid aside) not bigger than a child&rsquo;s.&nbsp; This
daunted me; nor less, the haggard surmise of misfortune in his
eye.&nbsp; Yet his voice was even peaceful as he inquired my
errand.&nbsp; I set my candle down upon a chair, leaned on the
bed-foot, and looked at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord Durrisdeer,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;it is very well
known to you that I am a partisan in your family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope we are none of us partisans,&rdquo; said
he.&nbsp; &ldquo;That you love my son sincerely, I have always
been glad to recognise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! my lord, we are past the hour of these
civilities,&rdquo; I replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;If we are to save
anything out of the fire, we must look the fact in its bare
countenance.&nbsp; A partisan I am; partisans we have all been;
it is as a partisan that I am here in the middle of the night to
plead before you.&nbsp; Hear me; before I go, I will tell you
why.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would always hear you, Mr. Mackellar,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;and that at any hour, whether of the day or night, for I
would be always sure you had a reason.&nbsp; You spoke once
before to very proper purpose; I have not forgotten
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am here to plead the cause of my master,&rdquo; I
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I need not tell you how he acts.&nbsp; You
know how he is placed.&nbsp; You know with what generosity, he
has always met your other&mdash;met your wishes,&rdquo; I
corrected myself, stumbling at that name of son.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
know&mdash;you must know&mdash;what he has suffered&mdash;what he
has suffered about his wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Mackellar!&rdquo; cried my lord, rising in bed like
a bearded lion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said you would hear me,&rdquo; I continued.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What you do not know, what you should know, one of the
things I am here to speak of, is the persecution he must bear in
private.&nbsp; Your back is not turned before one whom I dare not
name to you falls upon him with the most unfeeling taunts; twits
him&mdash;pardon me, my lord&mdash;twits him with your
partiality, calls him Jacob, calls him clown, pursues him with
ungenerous raillery, not to be borne by man.&nbsp; And let but
one of you appear, instantly he changes; and my master must smile
and courtesy to the man who has been feeding him with insults; I
know, for I have shared in some of it, and I tell you the life is
insupportable.&nbsp; All these months it has endured; it began
with the man&rsquo;s landing; it was by the name of Jacob that my
master was greeted the first night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My lord made a movement as if to throw aside the clothes and
rise.&nbsp; &ldquo;If there be any truth in this&mdash;&rdquo;
said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do I look like a man lying?&rdquo; I interrupted,
checking him with my hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should have told me at first,&rdquo; he odd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, my lord! indeed I should, and you may well hate the
face of this unfaithful servant!&rdquo; I cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will take order,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;at
once.&rdquo;&nbsp; And again made the movement to rise.</p>
<p>Again I checked him.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have not done,&rdquo; said
I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Would God I had!&nbsp; All this my dear,
unfortunate patron has endured without help or countenance.&nbsp;
Your own best word, my lord, was only gratitude.&nbsp; Oh, but he
was your son, too!&nbsp; He had no other father.&nbsp; He was
hated in the country, God knows how unjustly.&nbsp; He had a
loveless marriage.&nbsp; He stood on all hands without affection
or support&mdash;dear, generous, ill-fated, noble
heart!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your tears do you much honour and me much shame,&rdquo;
says my lord, with a palsied trembling.&nbsp; &ldquo;But you do
me some injustice.&nbsp; Henry has been ever dear to me, very
dear.&nbsp; James (I do not deny it, Mr. Mackellar), James is
perhaps dearer; you have not seen my James in quite a favourable
light; he has suffered under his misfortunes; and we can only
remember how great and how unmerited these were.&nbsp; And even
now his is the more affectionate nature.&nbsp; But I will not
speak of him.&nbsp; All that you say of Henry is most true; I do
not wonder, I know him to be very magnanimous; you will say I
trade upon the knowledge?&nbsp; It is possible; there are
dangerous virtues: virtues that tempt the encroacher.&nbsp; Mr.
Mackellar, I will make it up to him; I will take order with all
this.&nbsp; I have been weak; and, what is worse, I have been
dull!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must not hear you blame yourself, my lord, with that
which I have yet to tell upon my conscience,&rdquo; I
replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;You have not been weak; you have been
abused by a devilish dissembler.&nbsp; You saw yourself how he
had deceived you in the matter of his danger; he has deceived you
throughout in every step of his career.&nbsp; I wish to pluck him
from your heart; I wish to force your eyes upon your other son;
ah, you have a son there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;two sons&mdash;I have
two sons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I made some gesture of despair that struck him; he looked at
me with a changed face.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is much worse
behind?&rdquo; he asked, his voice dying as it rose upon the
question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much worse,&rdquo; I answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;This night
he said these words to Mr. Henry: &lsquo;I have never known a
woman who did not prefer me to you, and I think who did not
continue to prefer me.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will hear nothing against my daughter,&rdquo; he
cried; and from his readiness to stop me in this direction, I
conclude his eyes were not so dull as I had fancied, and he had
looked not without anxiety upon the siege of Mrs. Henry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think not of blaming her,&rdquo; cried I.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It is not that.&nbsp; These words were said in my hearing
to Mr. Henry; and if you find them not yet plain enough, these
others but a little after: Your wife, who is in love with
me!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have quarrelled?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must fly to them,&rdquo; he said, beginning once
again to leave his bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; I cried, holding forth my hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do not know,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;These are
dangerous words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will nothing make you understand, my lord?&rdquo; said
I.</p>
<p>His eyes besought me for the truth.</p>
<p>I flung myself on my knees by the bedside.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, my
lord,&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;think on him you have left; think of
this poor sinner whom you begot, whom your wife bore to you, whom
we have none of us strengthened as we could; think of him, not of
yourself; he is the other sufferer&mdash;think of him!&nbsp; That
is the door for sorrow&mdash;Christ&rsquo;s door, God&rsquo;s
door: oh! it stands open.&nbsp; Think of him, even as he thought
of you.&nbsp; &lsquo;<i>Who is to tell the old
man</i>?&rsquo;&mdash;these were his words.&nbsp; It was for that
I came; that is why I am here pleading at your feet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me get up,&rdquo; he cried, thrusting me aside, and
was on his feet before myself.&nbsp; His voice shook like a sail
in the wind, yet he spoke with a good loudness; his face was like
the snow, but his eyes were steady and dry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is too much speech,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Where was it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the shrubbery,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Mr. Henry?&rdquo; he asked.&nbsp; And when I had
told him he knotted his old face in thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Mr. James?&rdquo; says he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have left him lying,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;beside the
candles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Candles?&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp; And with that he ran to
the window, opened it, and looked abroad.&nbsp; &ldquo;It might
be spied from the road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where none goes by at such an hour,&rdquo; I
objected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It makes no matter,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;One
might.&nbsp; Hark!&rdquo; cries he.&nbsp; &ldquo;What is
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the sound of men very guardedly rowing in the bay; and
I told him so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The freetraders,&rdquo; said my lord.&nbsp; &ldquo;Run
at once, Mackellar; put these candles out.&nbsp; I will dress in
the meanwhile; and when you return we can debate on what is
wisest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I groped my way downstairs, and out at the door.&nbsp; From
quite a far way off a sheen was visible, making points of
brightness in the shrubbery; in so black a night it might have
been remarked for miles; and I blamed myself bitterly for my
incaution.&nbsp; How much more sharply when I reached the
place!&nbsp; One of the candlesticks was overthrown, and that
taper quenched.&nbsp; The other burned steadily by itself, and
made a broad space of light upon the frosted ground.&nbsp; All
within that circle seemed, by the force of contrast and the
overhanging blackness, brighter than by day.&nbsp; And there was
the bloodstain in the midst; and a little farther off Mr.
Henry&rsquo;s sword, the pommel of which was of silver; but of
the body, not a trace.&nbsp; My heart thumped upon my ribs, the
hair stirred upon my scalp, as I stood there staring&mdash;so
strange was the sight, so dire the fears it wakened.&nbsp; I
looked right and left; the ground was so hard, it told no
story.&nbsp; I stood and listened till my ears ached, but the
night was hollow about me like an empty church; not even a ripple
stirred upon the shore; it seemed you might have heard a pin drop
in the county.</p>
<p>I put the candle out, and the blackness fell about me groping
dark; it was like a crowd surrounding me; and I went back to the
house of Durrisdeer, with my chin upon my shoulder, startling, as
I went, with craven suppositions.&nbsp; In the door a figure
moved to meet me, and I had near screamed with terror ere I
recognised Mrs. Henry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you told him?&rdquo; says she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was he who sent me,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;It
is gone.&nbsp; But why are you here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is gone!&rdquo; she repeated.&nbsp; &ldquo;What is
gone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The body,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why are you not
with your husband?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone!&rdquo; said she.&nbsp; &ldquo;You cannot have
looked.&nbsp; Come back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no light now,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
dare not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can see in the dark.&nbsp; I have been standing here
so long&mdash;so long,&rdquo; said she.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come, give
me your hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We returned to the shrubbery hand in hand, and to the fatal
place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take care of the blood,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blood?&rdquo; she cried, and started violently
back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose it will be,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am
like a blind man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;nothing!&nbsp; Have you not
dreamed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, would to God we had!&rdquo; cried I.</p>
<p>She spied the sword, picked it up, and seeing the blood, let
it fall again with her hands thrown wide.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;
she cried.&nbsp; And then, with an instant courage, handled it
the second time, and thrust it to the hilt into the frozen
ground.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will take it back and clean it
properly,&rdquo; says she, and again looked about her on all
sides.&nbsp; &ldquo;It cannot be that he was dead?&rdquo; she
added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was no flutter of his heart,&rdquo; said I, and
then remembering: &ldquo;Why are you not with your
husband?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is no use,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;he will not speak
to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not speak to you?&rdquo; I repeated.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh!
you have not tried.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have a right to doubt me,&rdquo; she replied, with
a gentle dignity.</p>
<p>At this, for the first time, I was seized with sorrow for
her.&nbsp; &ldquo;God knows, madam,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;God
knows I am not so hard as I appear; on this dreadful night who
can veneer his words?&nbsp; But I am a friend to all who are not
Henry Durie&rsquo;s enemies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is hard, then, you should hesitate about his
wife,&rdquo; said she.</p>
<p>I saw all at once, like the rending of a veil, how nobly she
had borne this unnatural calamity, and how generously my
reproaches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must go back and tell this to my lord,&rdquo; said
I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Him I cannot face,&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will find him the least moved of all of us,&rdquo;
said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet I cannot face him,&rdquo; said she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you can return to Mr.
Henry; I will see my lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As we walked back, I bearing the candlesticks, she the
sword&mdash;a strange burthen for that woman&mdash;she had
another thought.&nbsp; &ldquo;Should we tell Henry?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let my lord decide,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>My lord was nearly dressed when I came to his chamber.&nbsp;
He heard me with a frown.&nbsp; &ldquo;The freetraders,&rdquo;
said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;But whether dead or alive?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought him&mdash;&rdquo; said I, and paused, ashamed
of the word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know; but you may very well have been in error.&nbsp;
Why should they remove him if not living?&rdquo; he asked.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh! here is a great door of hope.&nbsp; It must be given
out that he departed&mdash;as he came&mdash;without any note of
preparation.&nbsp; We must save all scandal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I saw he had fallen, like the rest of us, to think mainly of
the house.&nbsp; Now that all the living members of the family
were plunged in irremediable sorrow, it was strange how we turned
to that conjoint abstraction of the family itself, and sought to
bolster up the airy nothing of its reputation: not the Duries
only, but the hired steward himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are we to tell Mr. Henry?&rdquo; I asked him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will see,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am going
first to visit him; then I go forth with you to view the
shrubbery and consider.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We went downstairs into the hall.&nbsp; Mr. Henry sat by the
table with his head upon his hand, like a man of stone.&nbsp; His
wife stood a little back from him, her hand at her mouth; it was
plain she could not move him.&nbsp; My old lord walked very
steadily to where his son was sitting; he had a steady
countenance, too, but methought a little cold.&nbsp; When he was
come quite up, he held out both his hands and said, &ldquo;My
son!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a broken, strangled cry, Mr. Henry leaped up and fell on
his father&rsquo;s neck, crying and weeping, the most pitiful
sight that ever a man witnessed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh! father,&rdquo;
he cried, &ldquo;you know I loved him; you know I loved him in
the beginning; I could have died for him&mdash;you know
that!&nbsp; I would have given my life for him and you.&nbsp; Oh!
say you know that.&nbsp; Oh! say you can forgive me.&nbsp; O
father, father, what have I done&mdash;what have I done?&nbsp;
And we used to be bairns together!&rdquo; and wept and sobbed,
and fondled the old man, and clutched him about the neck, with
the passion of a child in terror.</p>
<p>And then he caught sight of his wife (you would have thought
for the first time), where she stood weeping to hear him, and in
a moment had fallen at her knees.&nbsp; &ldquo;And O my
lass,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;you must forgive me, too!&nbsp; Not
your husband&mdash;I have only been the ruin of your life.&nbsp;
But you knew me when I was a lad; there was no harm in Henry
Durie then; he meant aye to be a friend to you.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
him&mdash;it&rsquo;s the old bairn that played with you&mdash;oh,
can ye never, never forgive him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Throughout all this my lord was like a cold, kind spectator
with his wits about him.&nbsp; At the first cry, which was indeed
enough to call the house about us, he had said to me over his
shoulder, &ldquo;Close the door.&rdquo;&nbsp; And now he nodded
to himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We may leave him to his wife now,&rdquo; says he.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Bring a light, Mr. Mackellar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Upon my going forth again with my lord, I was aware of a
strange phenomenon; for though it was quite dark, and the night
not yet old, methought I smelt the morning.&nbsp; At the same
time there went a tossing through the branches of the evergreens,
so that they sounded like a quiet sea, and the air pulled at
times against our faces, and the flame of the candle shook.&nbsp;
We made the more speed, I believe, being surrounded by this
bustle; visited the scene of the duel, where my lord looked upon
the blood with stoicism; and passing farther on toward the
landing-place, came at last upon some evidences of the
truth.&nbsp; For, first of all, where there was a pool across the
path, the ice had been trodden in, plainly by more than one
man&rsquo;s weight; next, and but a little farther, a young tree
was broken, and down by the landing-place, where the
traders&rsquo; boats were usually beached, another stain of blood
marked where the body must have been infallibly set down to rest
the bearers.</p>
<p>This stain we set ourselves to wash away with the sea-water,
carrying it in my lord&rsquo;s hat; and as we were thus engaged
there came up a sudden moaning gust and left us instantly
benighted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will come to snow,&rdquo; says my lord; &ldquo;and
the best thing that we could hope.&nbsp; Let us go back now; we
can do nothing in the dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As we went houseward, the wind being again subsided, we were
aware of a strong pattering noise about us in the night; and when
we issued from the shelter of the trees, we found it raining
smartly.</p>
<p>Throughout the whole of this, my lord&rsquo;s clearness of
mind, no less than his activity of body, had not ceased to
minister to my amazement.&nbsp; He set the crown upon it in the
council we held on our return.&nbsp; The freetraders had
certainly secured the Master, though whether dead or alive we
were still left to our conjectures; the rain would, long before
day, wipe out all marks of the transaction; by this we must
profit.&nbsp; The Master had unexpectedly come after the fall of
night; it must now he given out he had as suddenly departed
before the break of day; and, to make all this plausible, it now
only remained for me to mount into the man&rsquo;s chamber, and
pack and conceal his baggage.&nbsp; True, we still lay at the
discretion of the traders; but that was the incurable weakness of
our guilt.</p>
<p>I heard him, as I said, with wonder, and hastened to
obey.&nbsp; Mr. and Mrs. Henry were gone from the hall; my lord,
for warmth&rsquo;s sake, hurried to his bed; there was still no
sign of stir among the servants, and as I went up the tower
stair, and entered the dead man&rsquo;s room, a horror of
solitude weighed upon my mind.&nbsp; To my extreme surprise, it
was all in the disorder of departure.&nbsp; Of his three
portmanteaux, two were already locked; the third lay open and
near full.&nbsp; At once there flashed upon me some suspicion of
the truth.&nbsp; The man had been going, after all; he had but
waited upon Crail, as Crail waited upon the wind; early in the
night the seamen had perceived the weather changing; the boat had
come to give notice of the change and call the passenger aboard,
and the boat&rsquo;s crew had stumbled on him dying in his
blood.&nbsp; Nay, and there was more behind.&nbsp; This
pre-arranged departure shed some light upon his inconceivable
insult of the night before; it was a parting shot, hatred being
no longer checked by policy.&nbsp; And, for another thing, the
nature of that insult, and the conduct of Mrs. Henry, pointed to
one conclusion, which I have never verified, and can now never
verify until the great assize&mdash;the conclusion that he had at
last forgotten himself, had gone too far in his advances, and had
been rebuffed.&nbsp; It can never be verified, as I say; but as I
thought of it that morning among his baggage, the thought was
sweet to me like honey.</p>
<p>Into the open portmanteau I dipped a little ere I closed
it.&nbsp; The most beautiful lace and linen, many suits of those
fine plain clothes in which he loved to appear; a book or two,
and those of the best, C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Commentaries,&rdquo; a volume of Mr. Hobbes, the
&ldquo;Henriade&rdquo; of M. de Voltaire, a book upon the Indies,
one on the mathematics, far beyond where I have studied: these
were what I observed with very mingled feelings.&nbsp; But in the
open portmanteau, no papers of any description.&nbsp; This set me
musing.&nbsp; It was possible the man was dead; but, since the
traders had carried him away, not likely.&nbsp; It was possible
he might still die of his wound; but it was also possible he
might not.&nbsp; And in this latter case I was determined to have
the means of some defence.</p>
<p>One after another I carried his portmanteaux to a loft in the
top of the house which we kept locked; went to my own room for my
keys, and, returning to the loft, had the gratification to find
two that fitted pretty well.&nbsp; In one of the portmanteaux
there was a shagreen letter-case, which I cut open with my knife;
and thenceforth (so far as any credit went) the man was at my
mercy.&nbsp; Here was a vast deal of gallant correspondence,
chiefly of his Paris days; and, what was more to the purpose,
here were the copies of his own reports to the English Secretary,
and the originals of the Secretary&rsquo;s answers: a most
damning series: such as to publish would be to wreck the
Master&rsquo;s honour and to set a price upon his life.&nbsp; I
chuckled to myself as I ran through the documents; I rubbed my
hands, I sang aloud in my glee.&nbsp; Day found me at the
pleasing task; nor did I then remit my diligence, except in so
far as I went to the window&mdash;looked out for a moment, to see
the frost quite gone, the world turned black again, and the rain
and the wind driving in the bay&mdash;and to assure myself that
the lugger was gone from its anchorage, and the Master (whether
dead or alive) now tumbling on the Irish Sea.</p>
<p>It is proper I should add in this place the very little I have
subsequently angled out upon the doings of that night.&nbsp; It
took me a long while to gather it; for we dared not openly ask,
and the freetraders regarded me with enmity, if not with
scorn.&nbsp; It was near six months before we even knew for
certain that the man survived; and it was years before I learned
from one of Crail&rsquo;s men, turned publican on his ill-gotten
gain, some particulars which smack to me of truth.&nbsp; It seems
the traders found the Master struggled on one elbow, and now
staring round him, and now gazing at the candle or at his hand
which was all bloodied, like a man stupid.&nbsp; Upon their
coming, he would seem to have found his mind, bade them carry him
aboard, and hold their tongues; and on the captain asking how he
had come in such a pickle, replied with a burst of passionate
swearing, and incontinently fainted.&nbsp; They held some debate,
but they were momently looking for a wind, they were highly paid
to smuggle him to France, and did not care to delay.&nbsp;
Besides which, he was well enough liked by these abominable
wretches: they supposed him under capital sentence, knew not in
what mischief he might have got his wound, and judged it a piece
of good nature to remove him out of the way of danger.&nbsp; So
he was taken aboard, recovered on the passage over, and was set
ashore a convalescent at the Havre de Grace.&nbsp; What is truly
notable: he said not a word to anyone of the duel, and not a
trader knows to this day in what quarrel, or by the hand of what
adversary, he fell.&nbsp; With any other man I should have set
this down to natural decency; with him, to pride.&nbsp; He could
not bear to avow, perhaps even to himself, that he had been
vanquished by one whom he had so much insulted whom he so cruelly
despised.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VI.&mdash;SUMMARY OF EVENTS DURING THE MASTER&rsquo;S
SECOND ABSENCE.</h2>
<p>Of the heavy sickness which declared itself next morning I can
think with equanimity, as of the last unmingled trouble that
befell my master; and even that was perhaps a mercy in disguise;
for what pains of the body could equal the miseries of his
mind?&nbsp; Mrs. Henry and I had the watching by the bed.&nbsp;
My old lord called from time to time to take the news, but would
not usually pass the door.&nbsp; Once, I remember, when hope was
nigh gone, he stepped to the bedside, looked awhile in his
son&rsquo;s face, and turned away with a gesture of the head and
hand thrown up, that remains upon my mind as something tragic;
such grief and such a scorn of sublunary things were there
expressed.&nbsp; But the most of the time Mrs. Henry and I had
the room to ourselves, taking turns by night, and bearing each
other company by day, for it was dreary watching.&nbsp; Mr.
Henry, his shaven head bound in a napkin, tossed fro without
remission, beating the bed with his hands.&nbsp; His tongue never
lay; his voice ran continuously like a river, so that my heart
was weary with the sound of it.&nbsp; It was notable, and to me
inexpressibly mortifying, that he spoke all the while on matters
of no import: comings and goings, horses&mdash;which he was ever
calling to have saddled, thinking perhaps (the poor soul!) that
he might ride away from his discomfort&mdash;matters of the
garden, the salmon nets, and (what I particularly raged to hear)
continually of his affairs, cyphering figures and holding
disputation with the tenantry.&nbsp; Never a word of his father
or his wife, nor of the Master, save only for a day or two, when
his mind dwelled entirely in the past, and he supposed himself a
boy again and upon some innocent child&rsquo;s play with his
brother.&nbsp; What made this the more affecting: it appeared the
Master had then run some peril of his life, for there was a
cry&mdash;&ldquo;Oh!&nbsp; Jamie will be drowned&mdash;Oh, save
Jamie!&rdquo; which he came over and over with a great deal of
passion.</p>
<p>This, I say, was affecting, both to Mrs. Henry and myself; but
the balance of my master&rsquo;s wanderings did him little
justice.&nbsp; It seemed he had set out to justify his
brother&rsquo;s calumnies; as though he was bent to prove himself
a man of a dry nature, immersed in money-getting.&nbsp; Had I
been there alone, I would not have troubled my thumb; but all the
while, as I listened, I was estimating the effect on the
man&rsquo;s wife, and telling myself that he fell lower every
day.&nbsp; I was the one person on the surface of the globe that
comprehended him, and I was bound there should be yet
another.&nbsp; Whether he was to die there and his virtues
perish: or whether he should save his days and come back to that
inheritance of sorrows, his right memory: I was bound he should
be heartily lamented in the one case, and unaffectedly welcomed
in the other, by the person he loved the most, his wife.</p>
<p>Finding no occasion of free speech, I bethought me at last of
a kind of documentary disclosure; and for some nights, when I was
off duty and should have been asleep, I gave my time to the
preparation of that which I may call my budget.&nbsp; But this I
found to be the easiest portion of my task, and that which
remained&mdash;namely, the presentation to my lady&mdash;almost
more than I had fortitude to overtake.&nbsp; Several days I went
about with my papers under my arm, spying for some juncture of
talk to serve as introduction.&nbsp; I will not deny but that
some offered; only when they did my tongue clove to the roof of
my mouth; and I think I might have been carrying about my packet
till this day, had not a fortunate accident delivered me from all
my hesitations.&nbsp; This was at night, when I was once more
leaving the room, the thing not yet done, and myself in despair
at my own cowardice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you carry about with you, Mr. Mackellar?&rdquo;
she asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;These last days, I see you always coming
in and out with the same armful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I returned upon my steps without a word, laid the papers
before her on the table, and left her to her reading.&nbsp; Of
what that was, I am now to give you some idea; and the best will
be to reproduce a letter of my own which came first in the budget
and of which (according to an excellent habitude) I have
preserved the scroll.&nbsp; It will show, too, the moderation of
my part in these affairs, a thing which some have called
recklessly in question.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Weary as I was with watching and distress of mind, it was
impossible for me to sleep.&nbsp; All night long I walked in my
chamber, revolving what should be the issue, and sometimes
repenting the temerity of my immixture in affairs so private; and
with the first peep of the morning I was at the sick-room
door.&nbsp; Mrs. Henry had thrown open the shutters and even the
window, for the temperature was mild.&nbsp; She looked
steadfastly before her; where was nothing to see, or only the
blue of the morning creeping among woods.&nbsp; Upon the stir of
my entrance she did not so much as turn about her face: a
circumstance from which I augured very ill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; I began; and then again,
&ldquo;Madam;&rdquo; but could make no more of it.&nbsp; Nor yet
did Mrs. Henry come to my assistance with a word.&nbsp; In this
pass I began gathering up the papers where they lay scattered on
the table; and the first thing that struck me, their bulk
appeared to have diminished.&nbsp; Once I ran them through, and
twice; but the correspondence with the Secretary of State, on
which I had reckoned so much against the future, was nowhere to
be found.&nbsp; I looked in the chimney; amid the smouldering
embers, black ashes of paper fluttered in the draught; and at
that my timidity vanished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good God, madam,&rdquo; cried I, in a voice not fitting
for a sick-room, &ldquo;Good God, madam, what have you done with
my papers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have burned them,&rdquo; said Mrs. Henry, turning
about.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is enough, it is too much, that you and I
have seen them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a fine night&rsquo;s work that you have
done!&rdquo; cried I.&nbsp; &ldquo;And all to save the reputation
of a man that ate bread by the shedding of his comrades&rsquo;
blood, as I do by the shedding of ink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To save the reputation of that family in which you are
a servant, Mr. Mackellar,&rdquo; she returned, &ldquo;and for
which you have already done so much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a family I will not serve much longer,&rdquo; I
cried, &ldquo;for I am driven desperate.&nbsp; You have stricken
the sword out of my hands; you have left us all
defenceless.&nbsp; I had always these letters I could shake over
his head; and now&mdash;What is to do?&nbsp; We are so falsely
situate we dare not show the man the door; the country would fly
on fire against us; and I had this one hold upon him&mdash;and
now it is gone&mdash;now he may come back to-morrow, and we must
all sit down with him to dinner, go for a stroll with him on the
terrace, or take a hand at cards, of all things, to divert his
leisure!&nbsp; No, madam!&nbsp; God forgive you, if He can find
it in His heart; for I cannot find it in mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder to find you so simple, Mr. Mackellar,&rdquo;
said Mrs. Henry.&nbsp; &ldquo;What does this man value
reputation?&nbsp; But he knows how high we prize it; he knows we
would rather die than make these letters public; and do you
suppose he would not trade upon the knowledge?&nbsp; What you
call your sword, Mr. Mackellar, and which had been one indeed
against a man of any remnant of propriety, would have been but a
sword of paper against him.&nbsp; He would smile in your face at
such a threat.&nbsp; He stands upon his degradation, he makes
that his strength; it is in vain to struggle with such
characters.&rdquo;&nbsp; She cried out this last a little
desperately, and then with more quiet: &ldquo;No, Mr. Mackellar;
I have thought upon this matter all night, and there is no way
out of it.&nbsp; Papers or no papers, the door of this house
stands open for him; he is the rightful heir, forsooth!&nbsp; If
we sought to exclude him, all would redound against poor Henry,
and I should see him stoned again upon the streets.&nbsp; Ah! if
Henry dies, it is a different matter!&nbsp; They have broke the
entail for their own good purposes; the estate goes to my
daughter; and I shall see who sets a foot upon it.&nbsp; But if
Henry lives, my poor Mr. Mackellar, and that man returns, we must
suffer: only this time it will be together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the whole I was well pleased with Mrs. Henry&rsquo;s
attitude of mind; nor could I even deny there was some cogency in
that which she advanced about the papers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us say no more about it,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I can only be sorry I trusted a lady with the originals,
which was an unbusinesslike proceeding at the best.&nbsp; As for
what I said of leaving the service of the family, it was spoken
with the tongue only; and you may set your mind at rest.&nbsp; I
belong to Durrisdeer, Mrs. Henry, as if I had been born
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I must do her the justice to say she seemed perfectly
relieved; so that we began this morning, as we were to continue
for so many years, on a proper ground of mutual indulgence and
respect.</p>
<p>The same day, which was certainly prededicate to joy, we
observed the first signal of recovery in Mr. Henry; and about
three of the following afternoon he found his mind again,
recognising me by name with the strongest evidences of
affection.&nbsp; Mrs. Henry was also in the room, at the bedfoot;
but it did not appear that he observed her.&nbsp; And indeed (the
fever being gone) he was so weak that he made but the one effort
and sank again into lethargy.&nbsp; The course of his restoration
was now slow but equal; every day his appetite improved; every
week we were able to remark an increase both of strength and
flesh; and before the end of the month he was out of bed and had
even begun to be carried in his chair upon the terrace.</p>
<p>It was perhaps at this time that Mrs. Henry and I were the
most uneasy in mind.&nbsp; Apprehension for his days was at an
end; and a worse fear succeeded.&nbsp; Every day we drew
consciously nearer to a day of reckoning; and the days passed on,
and still there was nothing.&nbsp; Mr. Henry bettered in
strength, he held long talks with us on a great diversity of
subjects, his father came and sat with him and went again; and
still there was no reference to the late tragedy or to the former
troubles which had brought it on.&nbsp; Did he remember, and
conceal his dreadful knowledge? or was the whole blotted from his
mind?&nbsp; This was the problem that kept us watching and
trembling all day when we were in his company and held us awake
at night when we were in our lonely beds.&nbsp; We knew not even
which alternative to hope for, both appearing so unnatural and
pointing so directly to an unsound brain.&nbsp; Once this fear
offered, I observed his conduct with sedulous
particularity.&nbsp; Something of the child he exhibited: a
cheerfulness quite foreign to his previous character, an interest
readily aroused, and then very tenacious, in small matters which
he had heretofore despised.&nbsp; When he was stricken down, I
was his only confidant, and I may say his only friend, and he was
on terms of division with his wife; upon his recovery, all was
changed, the past forgotten, the wife first and even single in
his thoughts.&nbsp; He turned to her with all his emotions, like
a child to its mother, and seemed secure of sympathy; called her
in all his needs with something of that querulous familiarity
that marks a certainty of indulgence; and I must say, in justice
to the woman, he was never disappointed.&nbsp; To her, indeed,
this changed behaviour was inexpressibly affecting; and I think
she felt it secretly as a reproach; so that I have seen her, in
early days, escape out of the room that she might indulge herself
in weeping.&nbsp; But to me the change appeared not natural; and
viewing it along with all the rest, I began to wonder, with many
head-shakings, whether his reason were perfectly erect.</p>
<p>As this doubt stretched over many years, endured indeed until
my master&rsquo;s death, and clouded all our subsequent
relations, I may well consider of it more at large.&nbsp; When he
was able to resume some charge of his affairs, I had many
opportunities to try him with precision.&nbsp; There was no lack
of understanding, nor yet of authority; but the old continuous
interest had quite departed; he grew readily fatigued, and fell
to yawning; and he carried into money relations, where it is
certainly out of place, a facility that bordered upon
slackness.&nbsp; True, since we had no longer the exactions of
the Master to contend against, there was the less occasion to
raise strictness into principle or do battle for a
farthing.&nbsp; True, again, there was nothing excessive in these
relaxations, or I would have been no party to them.&nbsp; But the
whole thing marked a change, very slight yet very perceptible;
and though no man could say my master had gone at all out of his
mind, no man could deny that he had drifted from his
character.&nbsp; It was the same to the end, with his manner and
appearance.&nbsp; Some of the heat of the fever lingered in his
veins: his movements a little hurried, his speech notably more
voluble, yet neither truly amiss.&nbsp; His whole mind stood open
to happy impressions, welcoming these and making much of them;
but the smallest suggestion of trouble or sorrow he received with
visible impatience and dismissed again with immediate
relief.&nbsp; It was to this temper that he owed the felicity of
his later days; and yet here it was, if anywhere, that you could
call the man insane.&nbsp; A great part of this life consists in
contemplating what we cannot cure; but Mr. Henry, if he could not
dismiss solicitude by an effort of the mind, must instantly and
at whatever cost annihilate the cause of it; so that he played
alternately the ostrich and the bull.&nbsp; It is to this
strenuous cowardice of pain that I have to set down all the
unfortunate and excessive steps of his subsequent career.&nbsp;
Certainly this was the reason of his beating McManus, the groom,
a thing so much out of all his former practice, and which
awakened so much comment at the time.&nbsp; It is to this, again,
that I must lay the total lose of near upon two hundred pounds,
more than the half of which I could have saved if his impatience
would have suffered me.&nbsp; But he preferred loss or any
desperate extreme to a continuance of mental suffering.</p>
<p>All this has led me far from our immediate trouble: whether he
remembered or had forgotten his late dreadful act; and if he
remembered, in what light he viewed it.&nbsp; The truth burst
upon us suddenly, and was indeed one of the chief surprises of my
life.&nbsp; He had been several times abroad, and was now
beginning to walk a little with an arm, when it chanced I should
be left alone with him upon the terrace.&nbsp; He turned to me
with a singular furtive smile, such as schoolboys use when in
fault; and says he, in a private whisper and without the least
preface: &ldquo;Where have you buried him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I could not make one sound in answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where have you buried him?&rdquo; he repeated.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I want to see his grave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I conceived I had best take the bull by the horns.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Mr. Henry,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I have news to give that
will rejoice you exceedingly.&nbsp; In all human likelihood, your
hands are clear of blood.&nbsp; I reason from certain indices;
and by these it should appear your brother was not dead, but was
carried in a swound on board the lugger.&nbsp; But now he may be
perfectly recovered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What there was in his countenance I could not read.&nbsp;
&ldquo;James?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your brother James,&rdquo; I answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
would not raise a hope that may be found deceptive, but in my
heart I think it very probable he is alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; says Mr. Henry; and suddenly rising from his
seat with more alacrity than he had yet discovered, set one
finger on my breast, and cried at me in a kind of screaming
whisper, &ldquo;Mackellar&rdquo;&mdash;these were his
words&mdash;&ldquo;nothing can kill that man.&nbsp; He is not
mortal.&nbsp; He is bound upon my back to all eternity&mdash;to
all eternity!&rdquo; says he, and, sitting down again, fell upon
a stubborn silence.</p>
<p>A day or two after, with the same secret smile, and first
looking about as if to be sure we were alone,
&ldquo;Mackellar,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;when you have any
intelligence, be sure and let me know.&nbsp; We must keep an eye
upon him, or he will take us when we least expect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will not show face here again,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes he will,&rdquo; said Mr. Henry.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Wherever I am, there will he be.&rdquo;&nbsp; And again he
looked all about him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must not dwell upon this thought, Mr. Henry,&rdquo;
said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that is a very good
advice.&nbsp; We will never think of it, except when you have
news.&nbsp; And we do not know yet,&rdquo; he added; &ldquo;he
may be dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The manner of his saying this convinced me thoroughly of what
I had scarce ventured to suspect: that, so far from suffering any
penitence for the attempt, he did but lament his failure.&nbsp;
This was a discovery I kept to myself, fearing it might do him a
prejudice with his wife.&nbsp; But I might have saved myself the
trouble; she had divined it for herself, and found the sentiment
quite natural.&nbsp; Indeed, I could not but say that there were
three of us, all of the same mind; nor could any news have
reached Durrisdeer more generally welcome than tidings of the
Master&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>This brings me to speak of the exception, my old lord.&nbsp;
As soon as my anxiety for my own master began to be relaxed, I
was aware of a change in the old gentleman, his father, that
seemed to threaten mortal consequences.</p>
<p>His face was pale and swollen; as he sat in the chimney-side
with his Latin, he would drop off sleeping and the book roll in
the ashes; some days he would drag his foot, others stumble in
speaking.&nbsp; The amenity of his behaviour appeared more
extreme; full of excuses for the least trouble, very thoughtful
for all; to myself, of a most flattering civility.&nbsp; One day,
that he had sent for his lawyer and remained a long while
private, he met me as he was crossing the hall with painful
footsteps, and took me kindly by the hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mr.
Mackellar,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I have had many occasions to
set a proper value on your services; and to-day, when I re-cast
my will, I have taken the freedom to name you for one of my
executors.&nbsp; I believe you bear love enough to our house to
render me this service.&rdquo;&nbsp; At that very time he passed
the greater portion of his days in clamber, from which it was
often difficult to rouse him; seemed to have losst all count of
years, and had several times (particularly on waking) called for
his wife and for an old servant whose very gravestone was now
green with moss.&nbsp; If I had been put to my oath, I must have
declared he was incapable of testing; and yet there was never a
will drawn more sensible in every trait, or showing a more
excellent judgment both of persons and affairs.</p>
<p>His dissolution, though it took not very long, proceeded by
infinitesimal gradations.&nbsp; His faculties decayed together
steadily; the power of his limbs was almost gone, he was
extremely deaf, his speech had sunk into mere mumblings; and yet
to the end he managed to discover something of his former
courtesy and kindness, pressing the hand of any that helped him,
presenting me with one of his Latin books, in which he had
laboriously traced my name, and in a thousand ways reminding us
of the greatness of that loss which it might almost be said we
had already suffered.&nbsp; To the end, the power of articulation
returned to him in flashes; it seemed he had only forgotten the
art of speech as a child forgets his lesson, and at times he
would call some part of it to mind.&nbsp; On the last night of
his life he suddenly broke silence with these words from Virgil:
&ldquo;Gnatique pratisque, alma, precor, miserere,&rdquo;
perfectly uttered, and with a fitting accent.&nbsp; At the sudden
clear sound of it we started from our several occupations; but it
was in vain we turned to him; he sat there silent, and, to all
appearance, fatuous.&nbsp; A little later he was had to bed with
more difficulty than ever before; and some time in the night,
without any more violence, his spirit fled.</p>
<p>At a far later period I chanced to speak of these particulars
with a doctor of medicine, a man of so high a reputation that I
scruple to adduce his name.&nbsp; By his view of it father and
son both suffered from the affection: the father from the strain
of his unnatural sorrows&mdash;the son perhaps in the excitation
of the fever; each had ruptured a vessel on the brain, and there
was probably (my doctor added) some predisposition in the family
to accidents of that description.&nbsp; The father sank, the son
recovered all the externals of a healthy man; but it is like
there was some destruction in those delicate tissues where the
soul resides and does her earthly business; her heavenly, I would
fain hope, cannot be thus obstructed by material accidents.&nbsp;
And yet, upon a more mature opinion, it matters not one jot; for
He who shall pass judgment on the records of our life is the same
that formed us in frailty.</p>
<p>The death of my old lord was the occasion of a fresh surprise
to us who watched the behaviour of his successor.&nbsp; To any
considering mind, the two sons had between them slain their
father, and he who took the sword might be even said to have
slain him with his hand, but no such thought appeared to trouble
my new lord.&nbsp; He was becomingly grave; I could scarce say
sorrowful, or only with a pleasant sorrow; talking of the dead
with a regretful cheerfulness, relating old examples of his
character, smiling at them with a good conscience; and when the
day of the funeral came round, doing the honours with exact
propriety.&nbsp; I could perceive, besides, that he found a solid
gratification in his accession to the title; the which he was
punctilious in exacting.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>And now there came upon the scene a new character, and one
that played his part, too, in the story; I mean the present lord,
Alexander, whose birth (17th July, 1757) filled the cup of my
poor master&rsquo;s happiness.&nbsp; There was nothing then left
him to wish for; nor yet leisure to wish for it.&nbsp; Indeed,
there never was a parent so fond and doting as he showed
himself.&nbsp; He was continually uneasy in his son&rsquo;s
absence.&nbsp; Was the child abroad? the father would be watching
the clouds in case it rained.&nbsp; Was it night? he would rise
out of his bed to observe its slumbers.&nbsp; His conversation
grew even wearyful to strangers, since he talked of little but
his son.&nbsp; In matters relating to the estate, all was
designed with a particular eye to Alexander; and it would
be:&mdash;&ldquo;Let us put it in hand at once, that the wood may
be grown against Alexander&rsquo;s majority;&rdquo; or,
&ldquo;This will fall in again handsomely for Alexander&rsquo;s
marriage.&rdquo;&nbsp; Every day this absorption of the
man&rsquo;s nature became more observable, with many touching and
some very blameworthy particulars.&nbsp; Soon the child could
walk abroad with him, at first on the terrace, hand in hand, and
afterward at large about the policies; and this grew to be my
lord&rsquo;s chief occupation.&nbsp; The sound of their two
voices (audible a great way off, for they spoke loud) became
familiar in the neighbourhood; and for my part I found it more
agreeable than the sound of birds.&nbsp; It was pretty to see the
pair returning, full of briars, and the father as flushed and
sometimes as bemuddied as the child, for they were equal sharers
in all sorts of boyish entertainment, digging in the beach,
damming of streams, and what not; and I have seen them gaze
through a fence at cattle with the same childish
contemplation.</p>
<p>The mention of these rambles brings me to a strange scene of
which I was a witness.&nbsp; There was one walk I never followed
myself without emotion, so often had I gone there upon miserable
errands, so much had there befallen against the house of
Durrisdeer.&nbsp; But the path lay handy from all points beyond
the Muckle Ross; and I was driven, although much against my will,
to take my use of it perhaps once in the two months.&nbsp; It
befell when Mr. Alexander was of the age of seven or eight, I had
some business on the far side in the morning, and entered the
shrubbery, on my homeward way, about nine of a bright
forenoon.&nbsp; It was that time of year when the woods are all
in their spring colours, the thorns all in flower, and the birds
in the high season of their singing.&nbsp; In contrast to this
merriment, the shrubbery was only the more sad, and I the more
oppressed by its associations.&nbsp; In this situation of spirit
it struck me disagreeably to hear voices a little way in front,
and to recognise the tones of my lord and Mr. Alexander.&nbsp; I
pushed ahead, and came presently into their view.&nbsp; They
stood together in the open space where the duel was, my lord with
his hand on his son&rsquo;s shoulder, and speaking with some
gravity.&nbsp; At least, as he raised his head upon my coming, I
thought I could perceive his countenance to lighten.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;here comes the good
Mackellar.&nbsp; I have just been telling Sandie the story of
this place, and how there was a man whom the devil tried to kill,
and how near he came to kill the devil instead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had thought it strange enough he should bring the child into
that scene; that he should actually be discoursing of his act,
passed measure.&nbsp; But the worst was yet to come; for he
added, turning to his son&mdash;&ldquo;You can ask Mackellar; he
was here and saw it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it true, Mr. Mackellar?&rdquo; asked the
child.&nbsp; &ldquo;And did you really see the devil?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not heard the tale,&rdquo; I replied; &ldquo;and
I am in a press of business.&rdquo;&nbsp; So far I said a little
sourly, fencing with the embarrassment of the position; and
suddenly the bitterness of the past, and the terror of that scene
by candle-light, rushed in upon my mind.&nbsp; I bethought me
that, for a difference of a second&rsquo;s quickness in parade,
the child before me might have never seen the day; and the
emotion that always fluttered round my heart in that dark
shrubbery burst forth in words.&nbsp; &ldquo;But so much is
true,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;that I have met the devil in these
woods, and seen him foiled here.&nbsp; Blessed be God that we
escaped with life&mdash;blessed be God that one stone yet stands
upon another in the walls of Durrisdeer!&nbsp; And, oh! Mr.
Alexander, if ever you come by this spot, though it was a hundred
years hence, and you came with the gayest and the highest in the
land, I would step aside and remember a bit prayer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My lord bowed his head gravely.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; says
he, &ldquo;Mackellar is always in the right.&nbsp; Come,
Alexander, take your bonnet off.&rdquo;&nbsp; And with that he
uncovered, and held out his hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;O Lord,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;I thank Thee, and my son thanks Thee, for Thy
manifold great mercies.&nbsp; Let us have peace for a little;
defend us from the evil man.&nbsp; Smite him, O Lord, upon the
lying mouth!&rdquo;&nbsp; The last broke out of him like a cry;
and at that, whether remembered anger choked his utterance, or
whether he perceived this was a singular sort of prayer, at least
he suddenly came to a full stop; and, after a moment, set back
his hat upon his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you have forgot a word, my lord,&rdquo; said
I.&nbsp; &ldquo;&lsquo;Forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive
them that trespass against us.&nbsp; For Thine is the kingdom,
and the power, and the glory, for ever and ever.&nbsp;
Amen.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! that is easy saying,&rdquo; said my lord.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That is very easy saying, Mackellar.&nbsp; But for me to
forgive!&mdash;I think I would cut a very silly figure if I had
the affectation to pretend it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bairn, my lord!&rdquo; said I, with some severity,
for I thought his expressions little fitted for the care of
children.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, very true,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;This is
dull work for a bairn.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s go nesting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I forget if it was the same day, but it was soon after, my
lord, finding me alone, opened himself a little more on the same
head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mackellar,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am now a very happy
man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so indeed, my lord,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and
the sight of it gives me a light heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is an obligation in happiness&mdash;do you not
think so?&rdquo; says he, musingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so indeed,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;and one in
sorrow, too.&nbsp; If we are not here to try to do the best, in
my humble opinion the sooner we are away the better for all
parties.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, but if you were in my shoes, would you forgive
him?&rdquo; asks my lord.</p>
<p>The suddenness of the attack a little gravelled me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a duty laid upon us strictly,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hut!&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;These are
expressions!&nbsp; Do you forgive the man yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;no!&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;God forgive
me, I do not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shake hands upon that!&rdquo; cries my lord, with a
kind of joviality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is an ill sentiment to shake hands upon,&rdquo; said
I, &ldquo;for Christian people.&nbsp; I think I will give you
mine on some more evangelical occasion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This I said, smiling a little; but as for my lord, he went
from the room laughing aloud.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>For my lord&rsquo;s slavery to the child, I can find no
expression adequate.&nbsp; He lost himself in that continual
thought: business, friends, and wife being all alike forgotten,
or only remembered with a painful effort, like that of one
struggling with a posset.&nbsp; It was most notable in the matter
of his wife.&nbsp; Since I had known Durrisdeer, she had been the
burthen of his thought and the loadstone of his eyes; and now she
was quite cast out.&nbsp; I have seen him come to the door of a
room, look round, and pass my lady over as though she were a dog
before the fire.&nbsp; It would be Alexander he was seeking, and
my lady knew it well.&nbsp; I have heard him speak to her so
ruggedly that I nearly found it in my heart to intervene: the
cause would still be the same, that she had in some way thwarted
Alexander.&nbsp; Without doubt this was in the nature of a
judgment on my lady.&nbsp; Without doubt she had the tables
turned upon her, as only Providence can do it; she who had been
cold so many years to every mark of tenderness, it was her part
now to be neglected: the more praise to her that she played it
well.</p>
<p>An odd situation resulted: that we had once more two parties
in the house, and that now I was of my lady&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Not
that ever I lost the love I bore my master.&nbsp; But, for one
thing, he had the less use for my society.&nbsp; For another, I
could not but compare the case of Mr. Alexander with that of Miss
Katharine; for whom my lord had never found the least
attention.&nbsp; And for a third, I was wounded by the change he
discovered to his wife, which struck me in the nature of an
infidelity.&nbsp; I could not but admire, besides, the constancy
and kindness she displayed.&nbsp; Perhaps her sentiment to my
lord, as it had been founded from the first in pity, was that
rather of a mother than a wife; perhaps it pleased her&mdash;if I
may so say&mdash;to behold her two children so happy in each
other; the more as one had suffered so unjustly in the
past.&nbsp; But, for all that, and though I could never trace in
her one spark of jealousy, she must fall back for society on poor
neglected Miss Katharine; and I, on my part, came to pass my
spare hours more and more with the mother and daughter.&nbsp; It
would be easy to make too much of this division, for it was a
pleasant family, as families go; still the thing existed; whether
my lord knew it or not, I am in doubt.&nbsp; I do not think he
did; he was bound up so entirely in his son; but the rest of us
knew it, and in a manner suffered from the knowledge.</p>
<p>What troubled us most, however, was the great and growing
danger to the child.&nbsp; My lord was his father over again; it
was to be feared the son would prove a second Master.&nbsp; Time
has proved these fears to have been quite exaggerate.&nbsp;
Certainly there is no more worthy gentleman to-day in Scotland
than the seventh Lord Durrisdeer.&nbsp; Of my own exodus from his
employment it does not become me to speak, above all in a
memorandum written only to justify his father. . . .</p>
<p>[<i>Editor&rsquo;s Note</i>.&nbsp; <i>Five pages of Mr.
Mackellar&rsquo;s MS. are here omitted</i>.&nbsp; <i>I have
gathered from their perusal an impression that Mr. Mackellar</i>,
<i>in his old age</i>, <i>was rather an exacting
servant</i>.&nbsp; <i>Against the seventh Lord Durrisdeer</i>
(<i>with whom</i>, <i>at any rate</i>, <i>we have no concern</i>)
<i>nothing material is alleged</i>.&mdash;R. L. S.]</p>
<p>. . . But our fear at the time was lest he should turn out, in
the person of his son, a second edition of his brother.&nbsp; My
lady had tried to interject some wholesome discipline; she had
been glad to give that up, and now looked on with secret dismay;
sometimes she even spoke of it by hints; and sometimes, when
there was brought to her knowledge some monstrous instance of my
lord&rsquo;s indulgence, she would betray herself in a gesture or
perhaps an exclamation.&nbsp; As for myself, I was haunted by the
thought both day and night: not so much for the child&rsquo;s
sake as for the father&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The man had gone to sleep,
he was dreaming a dream, and any rough wakening must infallibly
prove mortal.&nbsp; That he should survive its death was
inconceivable; and the fear of its dishonour made me cover my
face.</p>
<p>It was this continual preoccupation that screwed me up at last
to a remonstrance: a matter worthy to be narrated in
detail.&nbsp; My lord and I sat one day at the same table upon
some tedious business of detail; I have said that he had lost his
former interest in such occupations; he was plainly itching to be
gone, and he looked fretful, weary, and methought older than I
had ever previously observed.&nbsp; I suppose it was the haggard
face that put me suddenly upon my enterprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; said I, with my head down, and feigning
to continue my occupation&mdash;&ldquo;or, rather, let me call
you again by the name of Mr. Henry, for I fear your anger and
want you to think upon old times&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My good Mackellar!&rdquo; said he; and that in tones so
kindly that I had near forsook my purpose.&nbsp; But I called to
mind that I was speaking for his good, and stuck to my
colours.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has it never come in upon your mind what you are
doing?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I am doing?&rdquo; he repeated; &ldquo;I was never
good at guessing riddles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you are doing with your son?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, with some defiance in his tone,
&ldquo;and what am I doing with my son?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your father was a very good man,&rdquo; says I,
straying from the direct path.&nbsp; &ldquo;But do you think he
was a wise father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a pause before he spoke, and then: &ldquo;I say
nothing against him,&rdquo; he replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;I had the
most cause perhaps; but I say nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, there it is,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;You had
the cause at least.&nbsp; And yet your father was a good man; I
never knew a better, save on the one point, nor yet a
wiser.&nbsp; Where he stumbled, it is highly possible another man
should fail.&nbsp; He had the two sons&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>My lord rapped suddenly and violently on the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; cried he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Speak
out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will, then,&rdquo; said I, my voice almost strangled
with the thumping of my heart.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you continue to
indulge Mr. Alexander, you are following in your father&rsquo;s
footsteps.&nbsp; Beware, my lord, lest (when he grows up) your
son should follow in the Master&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had never meant to put the thing so crudely; but in the
extreme of fear, there comes a brutal kind of courage, the most
brutal indeed of all; and I burnt my ships with that plain
word.&nbsp; I never had the answer.&nbsp; When I lifted my head,
my lord had risen to his feet, and the next moment he fell
heavily on the floor.&nbsp; The fit or seizure endured not very
long; he came to himself vacantly, put his hand to his head,
which I was then supporting, and says he, in a broken voice:
&ldquo;I have been ill,&rdquo; and a little after: &ldquo;Help
me.&rdquo;&nbsp; I got him to his feet, and he stood pretty well,
though he kept hold of the table.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have been ill,
Mackellar,&rdquo; he said again.&nbsp; &ldquo;Something broke,
Mackellar&mdash;or was going to break, and then all swam
away.&nbsp; I think I was very angry.&nbsp; Never you mind,
Mackellar; never you mind, my man.&nbsp; I wouldnae hurt a hair
upon your head.&nbsp; Too much has come and gone.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s a certain thing between us two.&nbsp; But I think,
Mackellar, I will go to Mrs. Henry&mdash;I think I will go to
Mrs. Henry,&rdquo; said he, and got pretty steadily from the
room, leaving me overcome with penitence.</p>
<p>Presently the door flew open, and my lady swept in with
flashing eyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;What is all this?&rdquo; she
cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;What have you done to my husband?&nbsp; Will
nothing teach you your position in this house?&nbsp; Will you
never cease from making and meddling?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My lady,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;since I have been in
this house I have had plenty of hard words.&nbsp; For a while
they were my daily diet, and I swallowed them all.&nbsp; As for
to-day, you may call me what you please; you will never find the
name hard enough for such a blunder.&nbsp; And yet I meant it for
the best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I told her all with ingenuity, even as it is written here; and
when she had heard me out, she pondered, and I could see her
animosity fall.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you
meant well indeed.&nbsp; I have had the same thought myself, or
the same temptation rather, which makes me pardon you.&nbsp; But,
dear God, can you not understand that he can bear no more?&nbsp;
He can bear no more!&rdquo; she cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;The cord is
stretched to snapping.&nbsp; What matters the future if he have
one or two good days?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amen,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will meddle no
more.&nbsp; I am pleased enough that you should recognise the
kindness of my meaning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said my lady; &ldquo;but when it came to
the point, I have to suppose your courage failed you; for what
you said was said cruelly.&rdquo;&nbsp; She paused, looking at
me; then suddenly smiled a little, and said a singular thing:
&ldquo;Do you know what you are, Mr. Mackellar?&nbsp; You are an
old maid.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>No more incident of any note occurred in the family until the
return of that ill-starred man the Master.&nbsp; But I have to
place here a second extract from the memoirs of Chevalier Burke,
interesting in itself, and highly necessary for my purpose.&nbsp;
It is our only sight of the Master on his Indian travels; and the
first word in these pages of Secundra Dass.&nbsp; One fact, it is
to observe, appears here very clearly, which if we had known some
twenty years ago, how many calamities and sorrows had been
spared!&mdash;that Secundra Dass spoke English.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VII.&mdash;ADVENTURE OF CHEVALIER BURKE IN
INDIA.</h2>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>Extracted from his
Memoirs</i>.</p>
<p>. . . Here was I, therefore, on the streets of that city, the
name of which I cannot call to mind, while even then I was so
ill-acquainted with its situation that I knew not whether to go
south or north.&nbsp; The alert being sudden, I had run forth
without shoes or stockings; my hat had been struck from my head
in the mellay; my kit was in the hands of the English; I had no
companion but the cipaye, no weapon but my sword, and the devil a
coin in my pocket.&nbsp; In short, I was for all the world like
one of those calendars with whom Mr. Galland has made us
acquainted in his elegant tales.&nbsp; These gentlemen, you will
remember, were for ever falling in with extraordinary incidents;
and I was myself upon the brink of one so astonishing that I
protest I cannot explain it to this day.</p>
<p>The cipaye was a very honest man; he had served many years
with the French colours, and would have let himself be cut to
pieces for any of the brave countrymen of Mr. Lally.&nbsp; It is
the same fellow (his name has quite escaped me) of whom I have
narrated already a surprising instance of generosity of
mind&mdash;when he found Mr. de Fessac and myself upon the
ramparts, entirely overcome with liquor, and covered us with
straw while the commandant was passing by.&nbsp; I consulted him,
therefore, with perfect freedom.&nbsp; It was a fine question
what to do; but we decided at last to escalade a garden wall,
where we could certainly sleep in the shadow of the trees, and
might perhaps find an occasion to get hold of a pair of slippers
and a turban.&nbsp; In that part of the city we had only the
difficulty of the choice, for it was a quarter consisting
entirely of walled gardens, and the lanes which divided them were
at that hour of the night deserted.&nbsp; I gave the cipaye a
back, and we had soon dropped into a large enclosure full of
trees.&nbsp; The place was soaking with the dew, which, in that
country, is exceedingly unwholesome, above all to whites; yet my
fatigue was so extreme that I was already half asleep, when the
cipaye recalled me to my senses.&nbsp; In the far end of the
enclosure a bright light had suddenly shone out, and continued to
burn steadily among the leaves.&nbsp; It was a circumstance
highly unusual in such a place and hour; and, in our situation,
it behoved us to proceed with some timidity.&nbsp; The cipaye was
sent to reconnoitre, and pretty soon returned with the
intelligence that we had fallen extremely amiss, for the house
belonged to a white man, who was in all likelihood English.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Faith,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;if there is a white man to
be seen, I will have a look at him; for, the Lord be praised!
there are more sorts than the one!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cipaye led me forward accordingly to a place from which I
had a clear view upon the house.&nbsp; It was surrounded with a
wide verandah; a lamp, very well trimmed, stood upon the floor of
it, and on either side of the lamp there sat a man, cross-legged,
after the Oriental manner.&nbsp; Both, besides, were bundled up
in muslin like two natives; and yet one of them was not only a
white man, but a man very well known to me and the reader, being
indeed that very Master of Ballantrae of whose gallantry and
genius I have had to speak so often.&nbsp; Word had reached me
that he was come to the Indies, though we had never met at least,
and I heard little of his occupations.&nbsp; But, sure, I had no
sooner recognised him, and found myself in the arms of so old a
comrade, than I supposed my tribulations were quite done.&nbsp; I
stepped plainly forth into the light of the moon, which shone
exceeding strong, and hailing Ballantrae by name, made him in a
few words master of my grievous situation.&nbsp; He turned,
started the least thing in the world, looked me fair in the face
while I was speaking, and when I had done addressed himself to
his companion in the barbarous native dialect.&nbsp; The second
person, who was of an extraordinary delicate appearance, with
legs like walking canes and fingers like the stalk of a tobacco
pipe, <a name="citation6"></a><a href="#footnote6"
class="citation">[6]</a> now rose to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Sahib,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;understands no
English language.&nbsp; I understand it myself, and I see you
make some small mistake&mdash;oh! which may happen very
often.&nbsp; But the Sahib would be glad to know how you come in
a garden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ballantrae!&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;have you the damned
impudence to deny me to my face?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ballantrae never moved a muscle, staring at me like an image
in a pagoda.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Sahib understands no English language,&rdquo; says
the native, as glib as before.&nbsp; &ldquo;He be glad to know
how you come in a garden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! the divil fetch him,&rdquo; says I.&nbsp; &ldquo;He
would be glad to know how I come in a garden, would he?&nbsp;
Well, now, my dear man, just have the civility to tell the Sahib,
with my kind love, that we are two soldiers here whom he never
met and never heard of, but the cipaye is a broth of a boy, and I
am a broth of a boy myself; and if we don&rsquo;t get a full meal
of meat, and a turban, and slippers, and the value of a gold
mohur in small change as a matter of convenience, bedad, my
friend, I could lay my finger on a garden where there is going to
be trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They carried their comedy so far as to converse awhile in
Hindustanee; and then says the Hindu, with the same smile, but
sighing as if he were tired of the repetition, &ldquo;The Sahib
would be glad to know how you come in a garden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that the way of it?&rdquo; says I, and laying my
hand on my sword-hilt I bade the cipaye draw.</p>
<p>Ballantrae&rsquo;s Hindu, still smiling, pulled out a pistol
from his bosom, and though Ballantrae himself never moved a
muscle I knew him well enough to be sure he was prepared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Sahib thinks you better go away,&rdquo; says the
Hindu.</p>
<p>Well, to be plain, it was what I was thinking myself; for the
report of a pistol would have been, under Providence, the means
of hanging the pair of us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell the Sahib I consider him no gentleman,&rdquo; says
I, and turned away with a gesture of contempt.</p>
<p>I was not gone three steps when the voice of the Hindu called
me back.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Sahib would be glad to know if you are
a dam low Irishman,&rdquo; says he; and at the words Ballantrae
smiled and bowed very low.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; says I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Sahib say you ask your friend Mackellar,&rdquo;
says the Hindu.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Sahib he cry quits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell the Sahib I will give him a cure for the Scots
fiddle when next we meet,&rdquo; cried I.</p>
<p>The pair were still smiling as I left.</p>
<p>There is little doubt some flaws may be picked in my own
behaviour; and when a man, however gallant, appeals to posterity
with an account of his exploits, he must almost certainly expect
to share the fate of C&aelig;sar and Alexander, and to meet with
some detractors.&nbsp; But there is one thing that can never be
laid at the door of Francis Burke: he never turned his back on a
friend. . . .</p>
<p>(Here follows a passage which the Chevalier Burke has been at
the pains to delete before sending me his manuscript.&nbsp;
Doubtless it was some very natural complaint of what he supposed
to be an indiscretion on my part; though, indeed, I can call none
to mind.&nbsp; Perhaps Mr. Henry was less guarded; or it is just
possible the Master found the means to examine my correspondence,
and himself read the letter from Troyes: in revenge for which
this cruel jest was perpetrated on Mr. Burke in his extreme
necessity.&nbsp; The Master, for all his wickedness, was not
without some natural affection; I believe he was sincerely
attached to Mr. Burke in the beginning; but the thought of
treachery dried up the springs of his very shallow friendship,
and his detestable nature appeared naked.&mdash;E. McK.)</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII.&mdash;THE ENEMY IN THE HOUSE.</h2>
<p>It is a strange thing that I should be at a stick for a
date&mdash;the date, besides, of an incident that changed the
very nature of my life, and sent us all into foreign lands.&nbsp;
But the truth is, I was stricken out of all my habitudes, and
find my journals very ill redd-up, <a name="citation7"></a><a
href="#footnote7" class="citation">[7]</a> the day not indicated
sometimes for a week or two together, and the whole fashion of
the thing like that of a man near desperate.&nbsp; It was late in
March at least, or early in April, 1764.&nbsp; I had slept
heavily, and wakened with a premonition of some evil to
befall.&nbsp; So strong was this upon my spirit that I hurried
downstairs in my shirt and breeches, and my hand (I remember)
shook upon the rail.&nbsp; It was a cold, sunny morning, with a
thick white frost; the blackbirds sang exceeding sweet and loud
about the house of Durrisdeer, and there was a noise of the sea
in all the chambers.&nbsp; As I came by the doors of the hall,
another sound arrested me&mdash;of voices talking.&nbsp; I drew
nearer, and stood like a man dreaming.&nbsp; Here was certainly a
human voice, and that in my own master&rsquo;s house, and yet I
knew it not; certainly human speech, and that in my native land;
and yet, listen as I pleased, I could not catch one
syllable.&nbsp; An old tale started up in my mind of a fairy wife
(or perhaps only a wandering stranger), that came to the place of
my fathers some generations back, and stayed the matter of a
week, talking often in a tongue that signified nothing to the
hearers; and went again, as she had come, under cloud of night,
leaving not so much as a name behind her.&nbsp; A little fear I
had, but more curiosity; and I opened the hall-door, and
entered.</p>
<p>The supper-things still lay upon the table; the shutters were
still closed, although day peeped in the divisions; and the great
room was lighted only with a single taper and some lurching
reverberation of the fire.&nbsp; Close in the chimney sat two
men.&nbsp; The one that was wrapped in a cloak and wore boots, I
knew at once: it was the bird of ill omen back again.&nbsp; Of
the other, who was set close to the red embers, and made up into
a bundle like a mummy, I could but see that he was an alien, of a
darker hue than any man of Europe, very frailly built, with a
singular tall forehead, and a secret eye.&nbsp; Several bundles
and a small valise were on the floor; and to judge by the
smallness of this luggage, and by the condition of the
Master&rsquo;s boots, grossly patched by some unscrupulous
country cobbler, evil had not prospered.</p>
<p>He rose upon my entrance; our eyes crossed; and I know not why
it should have been, but my courage rose like a lark on a May
morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;is this you?&rdquo;&mdash;and
I was pleased with the unconcern of my own voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is even myself, worthy Mackellar,&rdquo; says the
Master.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This time you have brought the black dog visibly upon
your back,&rdquo; I continued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Referring to Secundra Dass?&rdquo; asked the
Master.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let me present you.&nbsp; He is a native
gentleman of India.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hum!&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am no great lover
either of you or your friends, Mr. Bally.&nbsp; But I will let a
little daylight in, and have a look at you.&rdquo;&nbsp; And so
saying, I undid the shutters of the eastern window.</p>
<p>By the light of the morning I could perceive the man was
changed.&nbsp; Later, when we were all together, I was more
struck to see how lightly time had dealt with him; but the first
glance was otherwise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are getting an old man,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>A shade came upon his face.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you could see
yourself,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you would perhaps not dwell upon
the topic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hut!&rdquo; I returned, &ldquo;old age is nothing to
me.&nbsp; I think I have been always old; and I am now, I thank
God, better known and more respected.&nbsp; It is not every one
that can say that, Mr. Bally!&nbsp; The lines in your brow are
calamities; your life begins to close in upon you like a prison;
death will soon be rapping at the door; and I see not from what
source you are to draw your consolations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here the Master addressed himself to Secundra Dass in
Hindustanee, from which I gathered (I freely confess, with a high
degree of pleasure) that my remarks annoyed him.&nbsp; All this
while, you may be sure, my mind had been busy upon other matters,
even while I rallied my enemy; and chiefly as to how I should
communicate secretly and quickly with my lord.&nbsp; To this, in
the breathing-space now given me, I turned all the forces of my
mind; when, suddenly shifting my eyes, I was aware of the man
himself standing in the doorway, and, to all appearance, quite
composed.&nbsp; He had no sooner met my looks than he stepped
across the threshold.&nbsp; The Master heard him coming, and
advanced upon the other side; about four feet apart, these
brothers came to a full pause, and stood exchanging steady looks,
and then my lord smiled, bowed a little forward, and turned
briskly away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mackellar,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;we must see to
breakfast for these travellers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was plain the Master was a trifle disconcerted; but he
assumed the more impudence of speech and manner.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
am as hungry as a hawk,&rdquo; says he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let it be
something good, Henry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My lord turned to him with the same hard smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord Durrisdeer,&rdquo; says he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! never in the family,&rdquo; returned the
Master.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every one in this house renders me my proper
title,&rdquo; says my lord.&nbsp; &ldquo;If it please you to make
an exception, I will leave you to consider what appearance it
will bear to strangers, and whether it may not be translated as
an effect of impotent jealousy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I could have clapped my hands together with delight: the more
so as my lord left no time for any answer, but, bidding me with a
sign to follow him, went straight out of the hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come quick,&rdquo; says he; &ldquo;we have to sweep
vermin from the house.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he sped through the
passages, with so swift a step that I could scarce keep up with
him, straight to the door of John Paul, the which he opened
without summons and walked in.&nbsp; John was, to all appearance,
sound asleep, but my lord made no pretence of waking him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;John Paul,&rdquo; said he, speaking as quietly as ever
I heard him, &ldquo;you served my father long, or I would pack
you from the house like a dog.&nbsp; If in half an hour&rsquo;s
time I find you gone, you shall continue to receive your wages in
Edinburgh.&nbsp; If you linger here or in St.
Bride&rsquo;s&mdash;old man, old servant, and altogether&mdash;I
shall find some very astonishing way to make you smart for your
disloyalty.&nbsp; Up and begone.&nbsp; The door you let them in
by will serve for your departure.&nbsp; I do not choose my son
shall see your face again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am rejoiced to find you bear the thing so
quietly,&rdquo; said I, when we were forth again by
ourselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quietly!&rdquo; cries he, and put my hand suddenly
against his heart, which struck upon his bosom like a sledge.</p>
<p>At this revelation I was filled with wonder and fear.&nbsp;
There was no constitution could bear so violent a
strain&mdash;his least of all, that was unhinged already; and I
decided in my mind that we must bring this monstrous situation to
an end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be well, I think, if I took word to my
lady,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; Indeed, he should have gone himself,
but I counted&mdash;not in vain&mdash;on his indifference.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;do.&nbsp; I will hurry
breakfast: we must all appear at the table, even Alexander; it
must appear we are untroubled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I ran to my lady&rsquo;s room, and with no preparatory cruelty
disclosed my news.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mind was long ago made up,&rdquo; said she.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We must make our packets secretly to-day, and leave
secretly to-night.&nbsp; Thank Heaven, we have another
house!&nbsp; The first ship that sails shall bear us to New
York.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what of him?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We leave him Durrisdeer,&rdquo; she cried.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Let him work his pleasure upon that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so, by your leave,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There shall be a dog at his heels that can hold
fast.&nbsp; Bed he shall have, and board, and a horse to ride
upon, if he behave himself; but the keys&mdash;if you think well
of it, my lady&mdash;shall be left in the hands of one
Mackellar.&nbsp; There will be good care taken; trust him for
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Mackellar,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;I thank you for
that thought.&nbsp; All shall be left in your hands.&nbsp; If we
must go into a savage country, I bequeath it to you to take our
vengeance.&nbsp; Send Macconochie to St. Bride&rsquo;s, to
arrange privately for horses and to call the lawyer.&nbsp; My
lord must leave procuration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment my lord came to the door, and we opened our
plan to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will never hear of it,&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;he
would think I feared him.&nbsp; I will stay in my own house,
please God, until I die.&nbsp; There lives not the man can beard
me out of it.&nbsp; Once and for all, here I am, and here I stay
in spite of all the devils in hell.&rdquo;&nbsp; I can give no
idea of the vehemency of his words and utterance; but we both
stood aghast, and I in particular, who had been a witness of his
former self-restraint.</p>
<p>My lady looked at me with an appeal that went to my heart and
recalled me to my wits.&nbsp; I made her a private sign to go,
and when my lord and I were alone, went up to him where he was
racing to and fro in one end of the room like a half-lunatic, and
set my hand firmly on his shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;I am going to be the
plain-dealer once more; if for the last time, so much the better,
for I am grown weary of the part.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing will change me,&rdquo; he answered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;God forbid I should refuse to hear you; but nothing will
change me.&rdquo;&nbsp; This he said firmly, with no signal of
the former violence, which already raised my hopes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said I&nbsp; &ldquo;I can afford to
waste my breath.&rdquo;&nbsp; I pointed to a chair, and he sat
down and looked at me.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can remember a time when my
lady very much neglected you,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never spoke of it while it lasted,&rdquo; returned my
lord, with a high flush of colour; &ldquo;and it is all changed
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know how much?&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do
you know how much it is all changed?&nbsp; The tables are turned,
my lord!&nbsp; It is my lady that now courts you for a word, a
look&mdash;ay, and courts you in vain.&nbsp; Do you know with
whom she passes her days while you are out gallivanting in the
policies?&nbsp; My lord, she is glad to pass them with a certain
dry old grieve <a name="citation8"></a><a href="#footnote8"
class="citation">[8]</a> of the name of Ephraim Mackellar; and I
think you may be able to remember what that means, for I am the
more in a mistake or you were once driven to the same company
yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mackellar!&rdquo; cries my lord, getting to his
feet.&nbsp; &ldquo;O my God, Mackellar!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is neither the name of Mackellar nor the name of God
that can change the truth,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;and I am telling
you the fact.&nbsp; Now for you, that suffered so much, to deal
out the same suffering to another, is that the part of any
Christian?&nbsp; But you are so swallowed up in your new friend
that the old are all forgotten.&nbsp; They are all clean vanished
from your memory.&nbsp; And yet they stood by you at the darkest;
my lady not the least.&nbsp; And does my lady ever cross your
mind?&nbsp; Does it ever cross your mind what she went through
that night?&mdash;or what manner of a wife she has been to you
thenceforward?&mdash;or in what kind of a position she finds
herself to-day?&nbsp; Never.&nbsp; It is your pride to stay and
face him out, and she must stay along with you.&nbsp; Oh! my
lord&rsquo;s pride&mdash;that&rsquo;s the great affair!&nbsp; And
yet she is the woman, and you are a great hulking man!&nbsp; She
is the woman that you swore to protect; and, more betoken, the
own mother of that son of yours!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are speaking very bitterly, Mackellar,&rdquo; said
he; &ldquo;but, the Lord knows, I fear you are speaking very
true.&nbsp; I have not proved worthy of my happiness.&nbsp; Bring
my lady back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My lady was waiting near at hand to learn the issue.&nbsp;
When I brought her in, my lord took a hand of each of us, and
laid them both upon his bosom.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have had two
friends in my life,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;All the comfort
ever I had, it came from one or other.&nbsp; When you two are in
a mind, I think I would be an ungrateful dog&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp;
He shut his mouth very hard, and looked on us with swimming
eyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do what ye like with me,&rdquo; says he,
&ldquo;only don&rsquo;t think&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; He stopped
again.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do what ye please with me: God knows I love
and honour you.&rdquo;&nbsp; And dropping our two hands, he
turned his back and went and gazed out of the window.&nbsp; But
my lady ran after, calling his name, and threw herself upon his
neck in a passion of weeping.</p>
<p>I went out and shut the door behind me, and stood and thanked
God from the bottom of my heart.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>At the breakfast board, according to my lord&rsquo;s design,
we were all met.&nbsp; The Master had by that time plucked off
his patched boots and made a toilet suitable to the hour;
Secundra Dass was no longer bundled up in wrappers, but wore a
decent plain black suit, which misbecame him strangely; and the
pair were at the great window, looking forth, when the family
entered.&nbsp; They turned; and the black man (as they had
already named him in the house) bowed almost to his knees, but
the Master was for running forward like one of the family.&nbsp;
My lady stopped him, curtseying low from the far end of the hall,
and keeping her children at her back.&nbsp; My lord was a little
in front: so there were the three cousins of Durrisdeer face to
face.&nbsp; The hand of time was very legible on all; I seemed to
read in their changed faces a <i>memento mori</i>; and what
affected me still more, it was the wicked man that bore his years
the handsomest.&nbsp; My lady was quite transfigured into the
matron, a becoming woman for the head of a great tableful of
children and dependents.&nbsp; My lord was grown slack in his
limbs; he stooped; he walked with a running motion, as though he
had learned again from Mr. Alexander; his face was drawn; it
seemed a trifle longer than of old; and it wore at times a smile
very singularly mingled, and which (in my eyes) appeared both
bitter and pathetic.&nbsp; But the Master still bore himself
erect, although perhaps with effort; his brow barred about the
centre with imperious lines, his mouth set as for command.&nbsp;
He had all the gravity and something of the splendour of Satan in
the &ldquo;Paradise Lost.&rdquo;&nbsp; I could not help but see
the man with admiration, and was only surprised that I saw him
with so little fear.</p>
<p>But indeed (as long as we were at the table) it seemed as if
his authority were quite vanished and his teeth all drawn.&nbsp;
We had known him a magician that controlled the elements; and
here he was, transformed into an ordinary gentleman, chatting
like his neighbours at the breakfast-board.&nbsp; For now the
father was dead, and my lord and lady reconciled, in what ear was
he to pour his calumnies?&nbsp; It came upon me in a kind of
vision how hugely I had overrated the man&rsquo;s subtlety.&nbsp;
He had his malice still; he was false as ever; and, the occasion
being gone that made his strength, he sat there impotent; he was
still the viper, but now spent his venom on a file.&nbsp; Two
more thoughts occurred to me while yet we sat at breakfast: the
first, that he was abashed&mdash;I had almost said,
distressed&mdash;to find his wickedness quite unavailing; the
second, that perhaps my lord was in the right, and we did amiss
to fly from our dismasted enemy.&nbsp; But my poor man&rsquo;s
leaping heart came in my mind, and I remembered it was for his
life we played the coward.</p>
<p>When the meal was over, the Master followed me to my room,
and, taking a chair (which I had never offered him), asked me
what was to be done with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Mr. Bally,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;the house will
still be open to you for a time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For a time?&rdquo; says he.&nbsp; &ldquo;I do not know
if I quite take your meaning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is plain enough,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;We keep
you for our reputation; as soon as you shall have publicly
disgraced yourself by some of your misconduct, we shall pack you
forth again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are become an impudent rogue,&rdquo; said the
Master, bending his brows at me dangerously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I learned in a good school,&rdquo; I returned.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And you must have perceived yourself that with my old
lord&rsquo;s death your power is quite departed.&nbsp; I do not
fear you now, Mr. Bally; I think even&mdash;God forgive
me&mdash;that I take a certain pleasure in your
company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He broke out in a burst of laughter, which I clearly saw to be
assumed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have come with empty pockets,&rdquo; says he, after a
pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not think there will be any money going,&rdquo; I
replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;I would advise you not to build on
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall have something to say on the point,&rdquo; he
returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed?&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have not a guess
what it will be, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! you affect confidence,&rdquo; said the
Master.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have still one strong position&mdash;that
you people fear a scandal, and I enjoy it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon me, Mr. Bally,&rdquo; says I.&nbsp; &ldquo;We do
not in the least fear a scandal against you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed again.&nbsp; &ldquo;You have been studying
repartee,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;But speech is very easy,
and sometimes very deceptive.&nbsp; I warn you fairly: you will
find me vitriol in the house.&nbsp; You would do wiser to pay
money down and see my back.&rdquo;&nbsp; And with that he waved
his hand to me and left the room.</p>
<p>A little after, my lord came with the lawyer, Mr. Carlyle; a
bottle of old wine was brought, and we all had a glass before we
fell to business.&nbsp; The necessary deeds were then prepared
and executed, and the Scotch estates made over in trust to Mr.
Carlyle and myself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is one point, Mr. Carlyle,&rdquo; said my lord,
when these affairs had been adjusted, &ldquo;on which I wish that
you would do us justice.&nbsp; This sudden departure coinciding
with my brother&rsquo;s return will be certainly commented
on.&nbsp; I wish you would discourage any conjunction of the
two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will make a point of it, my lord,&rdquo; said Mr.
Carlyle.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Mas&mdash; Bally does not, then,
accompany you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a point I must approach,&rdquo; said my
lord.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mr. Bally remains at Durrisdeer, under the
care of Mr. Mackellar; and I do not mean that he shall even know
our destination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Common report, however&mdash;&rdquo; began the
lawyer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! but, Mr. Carlyle, this is to be a secret quite
among ourselves,&rdquo; interrupted my lord.&nbsp; &ldquo;None
but you and Mackellar are to be made acquainted with my
movements.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Mr. Bally stays here?&nbsp; Quite so,&rdquo; said
Mr. Carlyle.&nbsp; &ldquo;The powers you
leave&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; Then he broke off again.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Mr. Mackellar, we have a rather heavy weight upon
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mr. Bally will
have no voice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will have no voice,&rdquo; said my lord; &ldquo;and,
I hope, no influence.&nbsp; Mr. Bally is not a good
adviser.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said the lawyer.&nbsp; &ldquo;By the way,
has Mr. Bally means?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand him to have nothing,&rdquo; replied my
lord.&nbsp; &ldquo;I give him table, fire, and candle in this
house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And in the matter of an allowance?&nbsp; If I am to
share the responsibility, you will see how highly desirable it is
that I should understand your views,&rdquo; said the
lawyer.&nbsp; &ldquo;On the question of an allowance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There will be no allowance,&rdquo; said my lord.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I wish Mr. Bally to live very private.&nbsp; We have not
always been gratified with his behaviour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And in the matter of money,&rdquo; I added, &ldquo;he
has shown himself an infamous bad husband.&nbsp; Glance your eye
upon that docket, Mr. Carlyle, where I have brought together the
different sums the man has drawn from the estate in the last
fifteen or twenty years.&nbsp; The total is pretty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Carlyle made the motion of whistling.&nbsp; &ldquo;I had
no guess of this,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Excuse me once
more, my lord, if I appear to push you; but it is really
desirable I should penetrate your intentions.&nbsp; Mr. Mackellar
might die, when I should find myself alone upon this trust.&nbsp;
Would it not be rather your lordship&rsquo;s preference that Mr.
Bally should&mdash;ahem&mdash;should leave the
country?&rdquo;</p>
<p>My lord looked at Mr. Carlyle.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why do you ask
that?&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I gather, my lord, that Mr. Bally is not a comfort to
his family,&rdquo; says the lawyer with a smile.</p>
<p>My lord&rsquo;s face became suddenly knotted.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
wish he was in hell!&rdquo; cried he, and filled himself a glass
of wine, but with a hand so tottering that he spilled the half
into his bosom.&nbsp; This was the second time that, in the midst
of the most regular and wise behaviour, his animosity had spirted
out.&nbsp; It startled Mr. Carlyle, who observed my lord
thenceforth with covert curiosity; and to me it restored the
certainty that we were acting for the best in view of my
lord&rsquo;s health and reason.</p>
<p>Except for this explosion the interview was very successfully
conducted.&nbsp; No doubt Mr. Carlyle would talk, as lawyers do,
little by little.&nbsp; We could thus feel we had laid the
foundations of a better feeling in the country, and the
man&rsquo;s own misconduct would certainly complete what we had
begun.&nbsp; Indeed, before his departure, the lawyer showed us
there had already gone abroad some glimmerings of the truth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should perhaps explain to you, my lord,&rdquo; said
he, pausing, with his hat in his hand, &ldquo;that I have not
been altogether surprised with your lordship&rsquo;s dispositions
in the case of Mr. Bally.&nbsp; Something of this nature oozed
out when he was last in Durrisdeer.&nbsp; There was some talk of
a woman at St. Bride&rsquo;s, to whom you had behaved extremely
handsome, and Mr. Bally with no small degree of cruelty.&nbsp;
There was the entail, again, which was much controverted.&nbsp;
In short, there was no want of talk, back and forward; and some
of our wise-acres took up a strong opinion.&nbsp; I remained in
suspense, as became one of my cloth; but Mr. Mackellar&rsquo;s
docket here has finally opened my eyes.&nbsp; I do not think, Mr.
Mackellar, that you and I will give him that much
rope.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The rest of that important day passed prosperously
through.&nbsp; It was our policy to keep the enemy in view, and I
took my turn to be his watchman with the rest.&nbsp; I think his
spirits rose as he perceived us to be so attentive, and I know
that mine insensibly declined.&nbsp; What chiefly daunted me was
the man&rsquo;s singular dexterity to worm himself into our
troubles.&nbsp; You may have felt (after a horse accident) the
hand of a bone-setter artfully divide and interrogate the
muscles, and settle strongly on the injured place?&nbsp; It was
so with the Master&rsquo;s tongue, that was so cunning to
question; and his eyes, that were so quick to observe.&nbsp; I
seemed to have said nothing, and yet to have let all out.&nbsp;
Before I knew where I was the man was condoling with me on my
lord&rsquo;s neglect of my lady and myself, and his hurtful
indulgence to his son.&nbsp; On this last point I perceived him
(with panic fear) to return repeatedly.&nbsp; The boy had
displayed a certain shrinking from his uncle; it was strong in my
mind his father had been fool enough to indoctrinate the same,
which was no wise beginning: and when I looked upon the man
before me, still so handsome, so apt a speaker, with so great a
variety of fortunes to relate, I saw he was the very personage to
captivate a boyish fancy.&nbsp; John Paul had left only that
morning; it was not to be supposed he had been altogether dumb
upon his favourite subject: so that here would be Mr. Alexander
in the part of Dido, with a curiosity inflamed to hear; and there
would be the Master, like a diabolical &AElig;neas, full of
matter the most pleasing in the world to any youthful ear, such
as battles, sea-disasters, flights, the forests of the West, and
(since his later voyage) the ancient cities of the Indies.&nbsp;
How cunningly these baits might be employed, and what an empire
might be so founded, little by little, in the mind of any boy,
stood obviously clear to me.&nbsp; There was no inhibition, so
long as the man was in the house, that would be strong enough to
hold these two apart; for if it be hard to charm serpents, it is
no very difficult thing to cast a glamour on a little chip of
manhood not very long in breeches.&nbsp; I recalled an ancient
sailor-man who dwelt in a lone house beyond the Figgate Whins (I
believe, he called it after Portobello), and how the boys would
troop out of Leith on a Saturday, and sit and listen to his
swearing tales, as thick as crows about a carrion: a thing I
often remarked as I went by, a young student, on my own more
meditative holiday diversion.&nbsp; Many of these boys went, no
doubt, in the face of an express command; many feared and even
hated the old brute of whom they made their hero; and I have seen
them flee from him when he was tipsy, and stone him when he was
drunk.&nbsp; And yet there they came each Saturday!&nbsp; How
much more easily would a boy like Mr. Alexander fall under the
influence of a high-looking, high-spoken gentleman-adventurer,
who should conceive the fancy to entrap him; and, the influence
gained, how easy to employ it for the child&rsquo;s
perversion!</p>
<p>I doubt if our enemy had named Mr. Alexander three times
before I perceived which way his mind was aiming&mdash;all this
train of thought and memory passed in one pulsation through my
own&mdash;and you may say I started back as though an open hole
had gaped across a pathway.&nbsp; Mr. Alexander: there was the
weak point, there was the Eve in our perishable paradise; and the
serpent was already hissing on the trail.</p>
<p>I promise you, I went the more heartily about the
preparations; my last scruple gone, the danger of delay written
before me in huge characters.&nbsp; From that moment forth I seem
not to have sat down or breathed.&nbsp; Now I would be at my post
with the Master and his Indian; now in the garret, buckling a
valise; now sending forth Macconochie by the side postern and the
wood-path to bear it to the trysting-place; and, again, snatching
some words of counsel with my lady.&nbsp; This was the
<i>verso</i> of our life in Durrisdeer that day; but on the
<i>recto</i> all appeared quite settled, as of a family at home
in its paternal seat; and what perturbation may have been
observable, the Master would set down to the blow of his
unlooked-for coming, and the fear he was accustomed to
inspire.</p>
<p>Supper went creditably off, cold salutations passed and the
company trooped to their respective chambers.&nbsp; I attended
the Master to the last.&nbsp; We had put him next door to his
Indian, in the north wing; because that was the most distant and
could be severed from the body of the house with doors.&nbsp; I
saw he was a kind friend or a good master (whichever it was) to
his Secundra Dass&mdash;seeing to his comfort; mending the fire
with his own hand, for the Indian complained of cold; inquiring
as to the rice on which the stranger made his diet; talking with
him pleasantly in the Hindustanee, while I stood by, my candle in
my hand, and affected to be overcome with slumber.&nbsp; At
length the Master observed my signals of distress.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
perceive,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;that you have all your ancient
habits: early to bed and early to rise.&nbsp; Yawn yourself
away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once in my own room, I made the customary motions of
undressing, so that I might time myself; and when the cycle was
complete, set my tinder-box ready, and blew out my taper.&nbsp;
The matter of an hour afterward I made a light again, put on my
shoes of list that I had worn by my lord&rsquo;s sick-bed, and
set forth into the house to call the voyagers.&nbsp; All were
dressed and waiting&mdash;my lord, my lady, Miss Katharine, Mr.
Alexander, my lady&rsquo;s woman Christie; and I observed the
effect of secrecy even upon quite innocent persons, that one
after another showed in the chink of the door a face as white as
paper.&nbsp; We slipped out of the side postern into a night of
darkness, scarce broken by a star or two; so that at first we
groped and stumbled and fell among the bushes.&nbsp; A few
hundred yards up the wood-path Macconochie was waiting us with a
great lantern; so the rest of the way we went easy enough, but
still in a kind of guilty silence.&nbsp; A little beyond the
abbey the path debauched on the main road and some quarter of a
mile farther, at the place called Eagles, where the moors begin,
we saw the lights of the two carriages stand shining by the
wayside.&nbsp; Scarce a word or two was uttered at our parting,
and these regarded business: a silent grasping of hands, a
turning of faces aside, and the thing was over; the horses broke
into a trot, the lamplight sped like Will-o&rsquo;-the-Wisp upon
the broken moorland, it dipped beyond Stony Brae; and there were
Macconochie and I alone with our lantern on the road.&nbsp; There
was one thing more to wait for, and that was the reappearance of
the coach upon Cartmore.&nbsp; It seems they must have pulled up
upon the summit, looked back for a last time, and seen our
lantern not yet moved away from the place of separation.&nbsp;
For a lamp was taken from a carriage, and waved three times up
and down by way of a farewell.&nbsp; And then they were gone
indeed, having looked their last on the kind roof of Durrisdeer,
their faces toward a barbarous country.&nbsp; I never knew
before, the greatness of that vault of night in which we two poor
serving-men&mdash;the one old, and the one elderly&mdash;stood
for the first time deserted; I had never felt before my own
dependency upon the countenance of others.&nbsp; The sense of
isolation burned in my bowels like a fire.&nbsp; It seemed that
we who remained at home were the true exiles, and that Durrisdeer
and Solwayside, and all that made my country native, its air good
to me, and its language welcome, had gone forth and was far over
the sea with my old masters.</p>
<p>The remainder of that night I paced to and fro on the smooth
highway, reflecting on the future and the past.&nbsp; My
thoughts, which at first dwelled tenderly on those who were just
gone, took a more manly temper as I considered what remained for
me to do.&nbsp; Day came upon the inland mountain-tops, and the
fowls began to cry, and the smoke of homesteads to arise in the
brown bosom of the moors, before I turned my face homeward, and
went down the path to where the roof of Durrisdeer shone in the
morning by the sea.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>At the customary hour I had the Master called, and awaited his
coming in the hall with a quiet mind.&nbsp; He looked about him
at the empty room and the three covers set.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are a small party,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;How
comes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the party to which we must grow
accustomed,&rdquo; I replied.</p>
<p>He looked at me with a sudden sharpness.&nbsp; &ldquo;What is
all this?&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You and I and your friend Mr. Dass are now all the
company,&rdquo; I replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;My lord, my lady, and the
children, are gone upon a voyage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon my word!&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Can this be
possible?&nbsp; I have indeed fluttered your Volscians in
Corioli!&nbsp; But this is no reason why our breakfast should go
cold.&nbsp; Sit down, Mr. Mackellar, if you
please&rdquo;&mdash;taking, as he spoke, the head of the table,
which I had designed to occupy myself&mdash;&ldquo;and as we eat,
you can give me the details of this evasion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I could see he was more affected than his language carried,
and I determined to equal him in coolness.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was
about to ask you to take the head of the table,&rdquo; said I;
&ldquo;for though I am now thrust into the position of your host,
I could never forget that you were, after all, a member of the
family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a while he played the part of entertainer, giving
directions to Macconochie, who received them with an evil grace,
and attending specially upon Secundra.&nbsp; &ldquo;And where has
my good family withdrawn to?&rdquo; he asked carelessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! Mr. Bally, that is another point,&rdquo; said
I.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have no orders to communicate their
destination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To me,&rdquo; he corrected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To any one,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the less pointed,&rdquo; said the master;
&ldquo;<i>c&rsquo;est de bon ton</i>: my brother improves as he
continues.&nbsp; And I, dear Mr. Mackellar?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will have bed and board, Mr. Bally,&rdquo; said
I.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am permitted to give you the run of the cellar,
which is pretty reasonably stocked.&nbsp; You have only to keep
well with me, which is no very difficult matter, and you shall
want neither for wine nor a saddle-horse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He made an excuse to send Macconochie from the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And for money?&rdquo; he inquired.&nbsp; &ldquo;Have I
to keep well with my good friend Mackellar for my pocket-money
also?&nbsp; This is a pleasing return to the principles of
boyhood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was no allowance made,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;but
I will take it on myself to see you are supplied in
moderation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In moderation?&rdquo; he repeated.&nbsp; &ldquo;And you
will take it on yourself?&rdquo;&nbsp; He drew himself up, and
looked about the hall at the dark rows of portraits.&nbsp;
&ldquo;In the name of my ancestors, I thank you,&rdquo; says he;
and then, with a return to irony, &ldquo;But there must certainly
be an allowance for Secundra Dass?&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It in not possible they have omitted that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will make a note of it, and ask instructions when I
write,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>And he, with a sudden change of manner, and leaning forward
with an elbow on the table&mdash;&ldquo;Do you think this
entirely wise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I execute my orders, Mr. Bally,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Profoundly modest,&rdquo; said the Master;
&ldquo;perhaps not equally ingenuous.&nbsp; You told me yesterday
my power was fallen with my father&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; How comes
it, then, that a peer of the realm flees under cloud of night out
of a house in which his fathers have stood several sieges? that
he conceals his address, which must be a matter of concern to his
Gracious Majesty and to the whole republic? and that he should
leave me in possession, and under the paternal charge of his
invaluable Mackellar?&nbsp; This smacks to me of a very
considerable and genuine apprehension.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I sought to interrupt him with some not very truthful
denegation; but he waved me down, and pursued his speech.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, it smacks of it,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but I
will go beyond that, for I think the apprehension grounded.&nbsp;
I came to this house with some reluctancy.&nbsp; In view of the
manner of my last departure, nothing but necessity could have
induced me to return.&nbsp; Money, however, is that which I must
have.&nbsp; You will not give with a good grace; well, I have the
power to force it from you.&nbsp; Inside of a week, without
leaving Durrisdeer, I will find out where these fools are fled
to.&nbsp; I will follow; and when I have run my quarry down, I
will drive a wedge into that family that shall once more burst it
into shivers.&nbsp; I shall see then whether my Lord
Durrisdeer&rdquo; (said with indescribable scorn and rage)
&ldquo;will choose to buy my absence; and you will all see
whether, by that time, I decide for profit or revenge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was amazed to hear the man so open.&nbsp; The truth is, he
was consumed with anger at my lord&rsquo;s successful flight,
felt himself to figure as a dupe, and was in no humour to weigh
language.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you consider <i>this</i> entirely wise?&rdquo; said
I, copying his words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These twenty years I have lived by my poor
wisdom,&rdquo; he answered with a smile that seemed almost
foolish in its vanity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And come out a beggar in the end,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;if beggar be a strong enough word for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would have you to observe, Mr. Mackellar,&rdquo;
cried he, with a sudden imperious heat, in which I could not but
admire him, &ldquo;that I am scrupulously civil: copy me in that,
and we shall be the better friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Throughout this dialogue I had been incommoded by the
observation of Secundra Dass.&nbsp; Not one of us, since the
first word, had made a feint of eating: our eyes were in each
other&rsquo;s faces&mdash;you might say, in each other&rsquo;s
bosoms; and those of the Indian troubled me with a certain
changing brightness, as of comprehension.&nbsp; But I brushed the
fancy aside, telling myself once more he understood no English;
only, from the gravity of both voices, and the occasional scorn
and anger in the Master&rsquo;s, smelled out there was something
of import in the wind.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>For the matter of three weeks we continued to live together in
the house of Durrisdeer: the beginning of that most singular
chapter of my life&mdash;what I must call my intimacy with the
Master.&nbsp; At first he was somewhat changeable in his
behaviour: now civil, now returning to his old manner of flouting
me to my face; and in both I met him half-way.&nbsp; Thanks be to
Providence, I had now no measure to keep with the man; and I was
never afraid of black brows, only of naked swords.&nbsp; So that
I found a certain entertainment in these bouts of incivility, and
was not always ill-inspired in my rejoinders.&nbsp; At last (it
was at supper) I had a droll expression that entirely vanquished
him.&nbsp; He laughed again and again; and &ldquo;Who would have
guessed,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;that this old wife had any wit
under his petticoats?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is no wit, Mr. Bally,&rdquo; said I: &ldquo;a dry
Scot&rsquo;s humour, and something of the driest.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And, indeed, I never had the least pretension to be thought a
wit.</p>
<p>From that hour he was never rude with me, but all passed
between us in a manner of pleasantry.&nbsp; One of our chief
times of daffing <a name="citation9"></a><a href="#footnote9"
class="citation">[9]</a> was when he required a horse, another
bottle, or some money.&nbsp; He would approach me then after the
manner of a schoolboy, and I would carry it on by way of being
his father: on both sides, with an infinity of mirth.&nbsp; I
could not but perceive that he thought more of me, which tickled
that poor part of mankind, the vanity.&nbsp; He dropped, besides
(I must suppose unconsciously), into a manner that was not only
familiar, but even friendly; and this, on the part of one who had
so long detested me, I found the more insidious.&nbsp; He went
little abroad; sometimes even refusing invitations.&nbsp;
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he would say, &ldquo;what do I care for these
thick-headed bonnet-lairds?&nbsp; I will stay at home, Mackellar;
and we shall share a bottle quietly, and have one of our good
talks.&rdquo;&nbsp; And, indeed, meal-time at Durrisdeer must
have been a delight to any one, by reason of the brilliancy of
the discourse.&nbsp; He would often express wonder at his former
indifference to my society.&nbsp; &ldquo;But, you see,&rdquo; he
would add, &ldquo;we were upon opposite sides.&nbsp; And so we
are to-day; but let us never speak of that.&nbsp; I would think
much less of you if you were not staunch to your
employer.&rdquo;&nbsp; You are to consider he seemed to me quite
impotent for any evil; and how it is a most engaging form of
flattery when (after many years) tardy justice is done to a
man&rsquo;s character and parts.&nbsp; But I have no thought to
excuse myself.&nbsp; I was to blame; I let him cajole me, and, in
short, I think the watch-dog was going sound asleep, when he was
suddenly aroused.</p>
<p>I should say the Indian was continually travelling to and fro
in the house.&nbsp; He never spoke, save in his own dialect and
with the Master; walked without sound; and was always turning up
where you would least expect him, fallen into a deep abstraction,
from which he would start (upon your coming) to mock you with one
of his grovelling obeisances.&nbsp; He seemed so quiet, so frail,
and so wrapped in his own fancies, that I came to pass him over
without much regard, or even to pity him for a harmless exile
from his country.&nbsp; And yet without doubt the creature was
still eavesdropping; and without doubt it was through his stealth
and my security that our secret reached the Master.</p>
<p>It was one very wild night, after supper, and when we had been
making more than usually merry, that the blow fell on me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is all very fine,&rdquo; says the Master,
&ldquo;but we should do better to be buckling our
valise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why so?&rdquo; I cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;Are you
leaving?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are all leaving to-morrow in the morning,&rdquo;
said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;For the port of Glascow first, thence for
the province of New York.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I suppose I must have groaned aloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;I boasted; I said a
week, and it has taken me near twenty days.&nbsp; But never mind;
I shall make it up; I will go the faster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you the money for this voyage?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear and ingenuous personage, I have,&rdquo; said
he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Blame me, if you choose, for my duplicity; but
while I have been wringing shillings from my daddy, I had a stock
of my own put by against a rainy day.&nbsp; You will pay for your
own passage, if you choose to accompany us on our flank march; I
have enough for Secundra and myself, but not more&mdash;enough to
be dangerous, not enough to be generous.&nbsp; There is, however,
an outside seat upon the chaise which I will let you have upon a
moderate commutation; so that the whole menagerie can go
together&mdash;the house-dog, the monkey, and the
tiger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I go with you,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I count upon it,&rdquo; said the Master.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You have seen me foiled; I mean you shall see me
victorious.&nbsp; To gain that I will risk wetting you like a sop
in this wild weather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And at least,&rdquo; I added, &ldquo;you know very well
you could not throw me off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not easily,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;You put your
finger on the point with your usual excellent good sense.&nbsp; I
never fight with the inevitable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose it is useless to appeal to you?&rdquo; said
I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Believe me, perfectly,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet, if you would give me time, I could
write&mdash;&rdquo; I began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what would be my Lord Durrisdeer&rsquo;s
answer?&rdquo; asks he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that is the rub.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, at any rate, how much more expeditions that I
should go myself!&rdquo; says he.&nbsp; &ldquo;But all this is
quite a waste of breath.&nbsp; At seven to-morrow the chaise will
be at the door.&nbsp; For I start from the door, Mackellar; I do
not skulk through woods and take my chaise upon the
wayside&mdash;shall we say, at Eagles?&rdquo;</p>
<p>My mind was now thoroughly made up.&nbsp; &ldquo;Can you spare
me quarter of an hour at St. Bride&rsquo;s?&rdquo; said I.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I have a little necessary business with
Carlyle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An hour, if you prefer,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
do not seek to deny that the money for your seat is an object to
me; and you could always get the first to Glascow with
saddle-horses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I never thought to leave
old Scotland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will brisken you up,&rdquo; says he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This will be an ill journey for some one,&rdquo; I
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think, sir, for you.&nbsp; Something speaks
in my bosom; and so much it says plain&mdash;that this is an
ill-omened journey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you take to prophecy,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;listen
to that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There came up a violent squall off the open Solway, and the
rain was dashed on the great windows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do ye ken what that bodes, warlock?&rdquo; said he, in
a broad accent: &ldquo;that there&rsquo;ll be a man Mackellar
unco&rsquo; sick at sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When I got to my chamber, I sat there under a painful
excitation, hearkening to the turmoil of the gale, which struck
full upon that gable of the house.&nbsp; What with the pressure
on my spirits, the eldritch cries of the wind among the
turret-tops, and the perpetual trepidation of the masoned house,
sleep fled my eyelids utterly.&nbsp; I sat by my taper, looking
on the black panes of the window, where the storm appeared
continually on the point of bursting in its entrance; and upon
that empty field I beheld a perspective of consequences that made
the hair to rise upon my scalp.&nbsp; The child corrupted, the
home broken up, my master dead or worse than dead, my mistress
plunged in desolation&mdash;all these I saw before me painted
brightly on the darkness; and the outcry of the wind appeared to
mock at my inaction.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IX.&mdash;MR. MACKELLAR&rsquo;S JOURNEY WITH THE
MASTER.</h2>
<p>The chaise came to the door in a strong drenching mist.&nbsp;
We took our leave in silence: the house of Durrisdeer standing
with dropping gutters and windows closed, like a place dedicate
to melancholy.&nbsp; I observed the Master kept his head out,
looking back on these splashed walls and glimmering roofs, till
they were suddenly swallowed in the mist; and I must suppose some
natural sadness fell upon the man at this departure; or was it
some provision of the end?&nbsp; At least, upon our mounting the
long brae from Durrisdeer, as we walked side by side in the wet,
he began first to whistle and then to sing the saddest of our
country tunes, which sets folk weeping in a tavern, <i>Wandering
Willie</i>.&nbsp; The set of words he used with it I have not
heard elsewhere, and could never come by any copy; but some of
them which were the most appropriate to our departure linger in
my memory.&nbsp; One verse began&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Home was home then, my dear, full of kindly
faces,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Home was home then, my dear, happy for the
child.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And ended somewhat thus&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Now, when day dawns on the brow of the
moorland,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Lone stands the house, and the chimney-stone is
cold.<br />
Lone let it stand, now the folks are all departed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The kind hearts, the true hearts, that loved the
place of old.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I could never be a judge of the merit of these verses; they
were so hallowed by the melancholy of the air, and were sung (or
rather &ldquo;soothed&rdquo;) to me by a master-singer at a time
so fitting.&nbsp; He looked in my face when he had done, and saw
that my eyes watered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&nbsp; Mackellar,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;do you
think I have never a regret?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not think you could be so bad a man,&rdquo; said
I, &ldquo;if you had not all the machinery to be a good
one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not all,&rdquo; says he: &ldquo;not all.&nbsp; You
are there in error.&nbsp; The malady of not wanting, my
evangelist.&rdquo;&nbsp; But methought he sighed as he mounted
again into the chaise.</p>
<p>All day long we journeyed in the same miserable weather: the
mist besetting us closely, the heavens incessantly weeping on my
head.&nbsp; The road lay over moorish hills, where was no sound
but the crying of moor-fowl in the wet heather and the pouring of
the swollen burns.&nbsp; Sometimes I would doze off in slumber,
when I would find myself plunged at once in some foul and ominous
nightmare, from the which I would awake strangling.&nbsp;
Sometimes, if the way was steep and the wheels turning slowly, I
would overhear the voices from within, talking in that tropical
tongue which was to me as inarticulate as the piping of the
fowls.&nbsp; Sometimes, at a longer ascent, the Master would set
foot to ground and walk by my side, mostly without speech.&nbsp;
And all the time, sleeping or waking, I beheld the same black
perspective of approaching ruin; and the same pictures rose in my
view, only they were now painted upon hillside mist.&nbsp; One, I
remember, stood before me with the colours of a true
illusion.&nbsp; It showed me my lord seated at a table in a small
room; his head, which was at first buried in his hands, he slowly
raised, and turned upon me a countenance from which hope had
fled.&nbsp; I saw it first on the black window-panes, my last
night in Durrisdeer; it haunted and returned upon me half the
voyage through; and yet it was no effect of lunacy, for I have
come to a ripe old age with no decay of my intelligence; nor yet
(as I was then tempted to suppose) a heaven-sent warning of the
future, for all manner of calamities befell, not that
calamity&mdash;and I saw many pitiful sights, but never that
one.</p>
<p>It was decided we should travel on all night; and it was
singular, once the dusk had fallen, my spirits somewhat
rose.&nbsp; The bright lamps, shining forth into the mist and on
the smoking horses and the hodding post-boy, gave me perhaps an
outlook intrinsically more cheerful than what day had shown; or
perhaps my mind had become wearied of its melancholy.&nbsp; At
least, I spent some waking hours, not without satisfaction in my
thoughts, although wet and weary in my body; and fell at last
into a natural slumber without dreams.&nbsp; Yet I must have been
at work even in the deepest of my sleep; and at work with at
least a measure of intelligence.&nbsp; For I started broad awake,
in the very act of crying out to myself</p>
<blockquote><p>Home was home then, my dear, happy for the
child,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>stricken to find in it an appropriateness, which I had not
yesterday observed, to the Master&rsquo;s detestable purpose in
the present journey.</p>
<p>We were then close upon the city of Glascow, where we were
soon breakfasting together at an inn, and where (as the devil
would have it) we found a ship in the very article of
sailing.&nbsp; We took our places in the cabin; and, two days
after, carried our effects on board.&nbsp; Her name was the
<i>Nonesuch</i>, a very ancient ship and very happily
named.&nbsp; By all accounts this should be her last voyage;
people shook their heads upon the quays, and I had several
warnings offered me by strangers in the street to the effect that
she was rotten as a cheese, too deeply loaden, and must
infallibly founder if we met a gale.&nbsp; From this it fell out
we were the only passengers; the Captain, McMurtrie, was a
silent, absorbed man, with the Glascow or Gaelic accent; the
mates ignorant rough seafarers, come in through the hawsehole;
and the Master and I were cast upon each other&rsquo;s
company.</p>
<p><i>The Nonesuch</i> carried a fair wind out of the Clyde, and
for near upon a week we enjoyed bright weather and a sense of
progress.&nbsp; I found myself (to my wonder) a born seaman, in
so far at least as I was never sick; yet I was far from tasting
the usual serenity of my health.&nbsp; Whether it was the motion
of the ship on the billows, the confinement, the salted food, or
all of these together, I suffered from a blackness of spirit and
a painful strain upon my temper.&nbsp; The nature of my errand on
that ship perhaps contributed; I think it did no more; the malady
(whatever it was) sprang from my environment; and if the ship
were not to blame, then it was the Master.&nbsp; Hatred and fear
are ill bedfellows; but (to my shame be it spoken) I have tasted
those in other places, lain down and got up with them, and eaten
and drunk with them, and yet never before, nor after, have I been
so poisoned through and through, in soul and body, as I was on
board the <i>Nonesuch</i>.&nbsp; I freely confess my enemy set me
a fair example of forbearance; in our worst days displayed the
most patient geniality, holding me in conversation as long as I
would suffer, and when I had rebuffed his civility, stretching
himself on deck to read.&nbsp; The book he had on board with him
was Mr. Richardson&rsquo;s famous <i>Clarissa</i>! and among
other small attentions he would read me passages aloud; nor could
any elocutionist have given with greater potency the pathetic
portions of that work.&nbsp; I would retort upon him with
passages out of the Bible, which was all my library&mdash;and
very fresh to me, my religious duties (I grieve to say it) being
always and even to this day extremely neglected.&nbsp; He tasted
the merits of the word like the connoisseur he was; and would
sometimes take it from my hand, turn the leaves over like a man
that knew his way, and give me, with his fine declamation, a
Roland for my Oliver.&nbsp; But it was singular how little he
applied his reading to himself; it passed high above his head
like summer thunder: Lovelace and Clarissa, the tales of
David&rsquo;s generosity, the psalms of his penitence, the solemn
questions of the book of Job, the touching poetry of
Isaiah&mdash;they were to him a source of entertainment only,
like the scraping of a fiddle in a change-house.&nbsp; This outer
sensibility and inner toughness set me against him; it seemed of
a piece with that impudent grossness which I knew to underlie the
veneer of his fine manners; and sometimes my gorge rose against
him as though he were deformed&mdash;and sometimes I would draw
away as though from something partly spectral.&nbsp; I had
moments when I thought of him as of a man of pasteboard&mdash;as
though, if one should strike smartly through the buckram of his
countenance, there would be found a mere vacuity within.&nbsp;
This horror (not merely fanciful, I think) vastly increased my
detestation of his neighbourhood; I began to feel something
shiver within me on his drawing near; I had at times a longing to
cry out; there were days when I thought I could have struck
him.&nbsp; This frame of mind was doubtless helped by shame,
because I had dropped during our last days at Durrisdeer into a
certain toleration of the man; and if any one had then told me I
should drop into it again, I must have laughed in his face.&nbsp;
It is possible he remained unconscious of this extreme fever of
my resentment; yet I think he was too quick; and rather that he
had fallen, in a long life of idleness, into a positive need of
company, which obliged him to confront and tolerate my
unconcealed aversion.&nbsp; Certain, at least, that he loved the
note of his own tongue, as, indeed, he entirely loved all the
parts and properties of himself; a sort of imbecility which
almost necessarily attends on wickedness.&nbsp; I have seen him
driven, when I proved recalcitrant, to long discourses with the
skipper; and this, although the man plainly testified his
weariness, fiddling miserably with both hand and foot, and
replying only with a grunt.</p>
<p>After the first week out we fell in with foul winds and heavy
weather.&nbsp; The sea was high.&nbsp; The <i>Nonesuch</i>, being
an old-fashioned ship and badly loaden, rolled beyond belief; so
that the skipper trembled for his masts, and I for my life.&nbsp;
We made no progress on our course.&nbsp; An unbearable ill-humour
settled on the ship: men, mates, and master, girding at one
another all day long.&nbsp; A saucy word on the one hand, and a
blow on the other, made a daily incident.&nbsp; There were times
when the whole crew refused their duty; and we of the afterguard
were twice got under arms&mdash;being the first time that ever I
bore weapons&mdash;in the fear of mutiny.</p>
<p>In the midst of our evil season sprang up a hurricane of wind;
so that all supposed she must go down.&nbsp; I was shut in the
cabin from noon of one day till sundown of the next; the Master
was somewhere lashed on deck.&nbsp; Secundra had eaten of some
drug and lay insensible; so you may say I passed these hours in
an unbroken solitude.&nbsp; At first I was terrified beyond
motion, and almost beyond thought, my mind appearing to be
frozen.&nbsp; Presently there stole in on me a ray of
comfort.&nbsp; If the <i>Nonesuch</i> foundered, she would carry
down with her into the deeps of that unsounded sea the creature
whom we all so feared and hated; there would be no more Master of
Ballantrae, the fish would sport among his ribs; his schemes all
brought to nothing, his harmless enemies at peace.&nbsp; At
first, I have said, it was but a ray of comfort; but it had soon
grown to be broad sunshine.&nbsp; The thought of the man&rsquo;s
death, of his deletion from this world, which he embittered for
so many, took possession of my mind.&nbsp; I hugged it, I found
it sweet in my belly.&nbsp; I conceived the ship&rsquo;s last
plunge, the sea bursting upon all sides into the cabin, the brief
mortal conflict there, all by myself, in that closed place; I
numbered the horrors, I had almost said with satisfaction; I felt
I could bear all and more, if the <i>Nonesuch</i> carried down
with her, overtook by the same ruin, the enemy of my poor
master&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; Towards noon of the second day the
screaming of the wind abated; the ship lay not so perilously
over, and it began to be clear to me that we were past the height
of the tempest.&nbsp; As I hope for mercy, I was singly
disappointed.&nbsp; In the selfishness of that vile, absorbing
passion of hatred, I forgot the case of our innocent shipmates,
and thought but of myself and my enemy.&nbsp; For myself, I was
already old; I had never been young, I was not formed for the
world&rsquo;s pleasures, I had few affections; it mattered not
the toss of a silver tester whether I was drowned there and then
in the Atlantic, or dribbled out a few more years, to die,
perhaps no less terribly, in a deserted sick-bed.&nbsp; Down I
went upon my knees&mdash;holding on by the locker, or else I had
been instantly dashed across the tossing cabin&mdash;and, lifting
up my voice in the midst of that clamour of the abating
hurricane, impiously prayed for my own death.&nbsp; &ldquo;O
God!&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;I would be liker a man if I rose and
struck this creature down; but Thou madest me a coward from my
mother&rsquo;s womb. O Lord, Thou madest me so, Thou knowest my
weakness, Thou knowest that any face of death will set me shaking
in my shoes.&nbsp; But, lo! here is Thy servant ready, his mortal
weakness laid aside.&nbsp; Let me give my life for this
creature&rsquo;s; take the two of them, Lord! take the two, and
have mercy on the innocent!&rdquo;&nbsp; In some such words as
these, only yet more irreverent and with more sacred adjurations,
I continued to pour forth my spirit.&nbsp; God heard me not, I
must suppose in mercy; and I was still absorbed in my agony of
supplication when some one, removing the tarpaulin cover, let the
light of the sunset pour into the cabin.&nbsp; I stumbled to my
feet ashamed, and was seized with surprise to find myself totter
and ache like one that had been stretched upon the rack.&nbsp;
Secundra Dass, who had slept off the effects of his drug, stood
in a corner not far off, gazing at me with wild eyes; and from
the open skylight the captain thanked me for my
supplications.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s you that saved the ship, Mr.
Mackellar,&rdquo; says he.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is no craft of
seamanship that could have kept her floating: well may we say,
&lsquo;Except the Lord the city keep, the watchmen watch in
vain!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was abashed by the captain&rsquo;s error; abashed, also, by
the surprise and fear with which the Indian regarded me at first,
and the obsequious civilities with which he soon began to cumber
me.&nbsp; I know now that he must have overheard and comprehended
the peculiar nature of my prayers.&nbsp; It is certain, of
course, that he at once disclosed the matter to his patron; and
looking back with greater knowledge, I can now understand what so
much puzzled me at the moment, those singular and (so to speak)
approving smiles with which the Master honoured me.&nbsp;
Similarly, I can understand a word that I remember to have fallen
from him in conversation that same night; when, holding up his
hand and smiling, &ldquo;Ah! Mackellar,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;not every man is so great a coward as he thinks he
is&mdash;nor yet so good a Christian.&rdquo;&nbsp; He did not
guess how true he spoke!&nbsp; For the fact is, the thoughts
which had come to me in the violence of the storm retained their
hold upon my spirit; and the words that rose to my lips unbidden
in the instancy of prayer continued to sound in my ears: with
what shameful consequences, it is fitting I should honestly
relate; for I could not support a part of such disloyalty as to
describe the sins of others and conceal my own.</p>
<p>The wind fell, but the sea hove ever the higher.&nbsp; All
night the <i>Nonesuch</i> rolled outrageously; the next day
dawned, and the next, and brought no change.&nbsp; To cross the
cabin was scarce possible; old experienced seamen were cast down
upon the deck, and one cruelly mauled in the concussion; every
board and block in the old ship cried out aloud; and the great
bell by the anchor-bitts continually and dolefully rang.&nbsp;
One of these days the Master and I sate alone together at the
break of the poop.&nbsp; I should say the <i>Nonesuch</i> carried
a high, raised poop.&nbsp; About the top of it ran considerable
bulwarks, which made the ship unweatherly; and these, as they
approached the front on each side, ran down in a fine,
old-fashioned, carven scroll to join the bulwarks of the
waist.&nbsp; From this disposition, which seems designed rather
for ornament than use, it followed there was a discontinuance of
protection: and that, besides, at the very margin of the elevated
part where (in certain movements of the ship) it might be the
most needful.&nbsp; It was here we were sitting: our feet hanging
down, the Master betwixt me and the side, and I holding on with
both hands to the grating of the cabin skylight; for it struck me
it was a dangerous position, the more so as I had continually
before my eyes a measure of our evolutions in the person of the
Master, which stood out in the break of the bulwarks against the
sun.&nbsp; Now his head would be in the zenith and his shadow
fall quite beyond the <i>Nonesuch</i> on the farther side; and
now he would swing down till he was underneath my feet, and the
line of the sea leaped high above him like the ceiling of a
room.&nbsp; I looked on upon this with a growing fascination, as
birds are said to look on snakes.&nbsp; My mind, besides, was
troubled with an astonishing diversity of noises; for now that we
had all sails spread in the vain hope to bring her to the sea,
the ship sounded like a factory with their reverberations.&nbsp;
We spoke first of the mutiny with which we had been threatened;
this led us on to the topic of assassination; and that offered a
temptation to the Master more strong than he was able to
resist.&nbsp; He must tell me a tale, and show me at the same
time how clever he was and how wicked.&nbsp; It was a thing he
did always with affectation and display; generally with a good
effect.&nbsp; But this tale, told in a high key in the midst of
so great a tumult, and by a narrator who was one moment looking
down at me from the skies and the next up from under the soles of
my feet&mdash;this particular tale, I say, took hold upon me in a
degree quite singular.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My friend the count,&rdquo; it was thus that he began
his story, &ldquo;had for an enemy a certain German baron, a
stranger in Rome.&nbsp; It matters not what was the ground of the
count&rsquo;s enmity; but as he had a firm design to be revenged,
and that with safety to himself, he kept it secret even from the
baron.&nbsp; Indeed, that is the first principle of vengeance;
and hatred betrayed is hatred impotent.&nbsp; The count was a man
of a curious, searching mind; he had something of the artist; if
anything fell for him to do, it must always be done with an exact
perfection, not only as to the result, but in the very means and
instruments, or he thought the thing miscarried.&nbsp; It chanced
he was one day riding in the outer suburbs, when he came to a
disused by-road branching off into the moor which lies about
Rome.&nbsp; On the one hand was an ancient Roman tomb; on the
other a deserted house in a garden of evergreen trees.&nbsp; This
road brought him presently into a field of ruins, in the midst of
which, in the side of a hill, he saw an open door, and, not far
off, a single stunted pine no greater than a currant-bush.&nbsp;
The place was desert and very secret; a voice spoke in the
count&rsquo;s bosom that there was something here to his
advantage.&nbsp; He tied his horse to the pine-tree, took his
flint and steel in his hand to make a light, and entered into the
hill.&nbsp; The doorway opened on a passage of old Roman masonry,
which shortly after branched in two.&nbsp; The count took the
turning to the right, and followed it, groping forward in the
dark, till he was brought up by a kind of fence, about
elbow-high, which extended quite across the passage.&nbsp;
Sounding forward with his foot, he found an edge of polished
stone, and then vacancy.&nbsp; All his curiosity was now
awakened, and, getting some rotten sticks that lay about the
floor, he made a fire.&nbsp; In front of him was a profound well;
doubtless some neighbouring peasant had once used it for his
water, and it was he that had set up the fence.&nbsp; A long
while the count stood leaning on the rail and looking down into
the pit.&nbsp; It was of Roman foundation, and, like all that
nation set their hands to, built as for eternity; the sides were
still straight, and the joints smooth; to a man who should fall
in, no escape was possible.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now,&rsquo; the count
was thinking, &lsquo;a strong impulsion brought me to this
place.&nbsp; What for? what have I gained? why should I be sent
to gaze into this well?&rsquo; when the rail of the fence gave
suddenly under his weight, and he came within an ace of falling
headlong in.&nbsp; Leaping back to save himself, he trod out the
last flicker of his fire, which gave him thenceforward no more
light, only an incommoding smoke.&nbsp; &lsquo;Was I sent here to
my death?&rsquo; says he, and shook from head to foot.&nbsp; And
then a thought flashed in his mind.&nbsp; He crept forth on hands
and knees to the brink of the pit, and felt above him in the
air.&nbsp; The rail had been fast to a pair of uprights; it had
only broken from the one, and still depended from the
other.&nbsp; The count set it back again as he had found it, so
that the place meant death to the first comer, and groped out of
the catacomb like a sick man.&nbsp; The next day, riding in the
Corso with the baron, he purposely betrayed a strong
preoccupation.&nbsp; The other (as he had designed) inquired into
the cause; and he, after some fencing, admitted that his spirits
had been dashed by an unusual dream.&nbsp; This was calculated to
draw on the baron&mdash;a superstitious man, who affected the
scorn of superstition.&nbsp; Some rallying followed, and then the
count, as if suddenly carried away, called on his friend to
beware, for it was of him that he had dreamed.&nbsp; You know
enough of human nature, my excellent Mackellar, to be certain of
one thing: I mean that the baron did not rest till he had heard
the dream.&nbsp; The count, sure that he would never desist, kept
him in play till his curiosity was highly inflamed, and then
suffered himself, with seeming reluctance, to be overborne.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I warn you,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;evil will come of it;
something tells me so.&nbsp; But since there is to be no peace
either for you or me except on this condition, the blame be on
your own head!&nbsp; This was the dream:&mdash;I beheld you
riding, I know not where, yet I think it must have been near
Rome, for on your one hand was an ancient tomb, and on the other
a garden of evergreen trees.&nbsp; Methought I cried and cried
upon you to come back in a very agony of terror; whether you
heard me I know not, but you went doggedly on.&nbsp; The road
brought you to a desert place among ruins, where was a door in a
hillside, and hard by the door a misbegotten pine.&nbsp; Here you
dismounted (I still crying on you to beware), tied your horse to
the pine-tree, and entered resolutely in by the door.&nbsp;
Within, it was dark; but in my dream I could still see you, and
still besought you to hold back.&nbsp; You felt your way along
the right-hand wall, took a branching passage to the right, and
came to a little chamber, where was a well with a railing.&nbsp;
At this&mdash;I know not why&mdash;my alarm for you increased a
thousandfold, so that I seemed to scream myself hoarse with
warnings, crying it was still time, and bidding you begone at
once from that vestibule.&nbsp; Such was the word I used in my
dream, and it seemed then to have a clear significancy; but
to-day, and awake, I profess I know not what it means.&nbsp; To
all my outcry you rendered not the least attention, leaning the
while upon the rail and looking down intently in the water.&nbsp;
And then there was made to you a communication; I do not think I
even gathered what it was, but the fear of it plucked me clean
out of my slumber, and I awoke shaking and sobbing.&nbsp; And
now,&rsquo; continues the count, &lsquo;I thank you from my heart
for your insistency.&nbsp; This dream lay on me like a load; and
now I have told it in plain words and in the broad daylight, it
seems no great matter.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;I do not know,&rsquo;
says the baron.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is in some points strange.&nbsp;
A communication, did you say?&nbsp; Oh! it is an odd dream.&nbsp;
It will make a story to amuse our friends.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;I
am not so sure,&rsquo; says the count.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am sensible
of some reluctancy.&nbsp; Let us rather forget
it.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;By all means,&rsquo; says the
baron.&nbsp; And (in fact) the dream was not again referred
to.&nbsp; Some days after, the count proposed a ride in the
fields, which the baron (since they were daily growing faster
friends) very readily accepted.&nbsp; On the way back to Rome,
the count led them insensibly by a particular route.&nbsp;
Presently he reined in his horse, clapped his hand before his
eyes, and cried out aloud.&nbsp; Then he showed his face again
(which was now quite white, for he was a consummate actor), and
stared upon the baron.&nbsp; &lsquo;What ails you?&rsquo; cries
the baron.&nbsp; &lsquo;What is wrong with
you?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Nothing,&rsquo; cries the count.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It is nothing.&nbsp; A seizure, I know not what.&nbsp; Let
us hurry back to Rome.&rsquo;&nbsp; But in the meanwhile the
baron had looked about him; and there, on the left-hand side of
the way as they went back to Rome, he saw a dusty by-road with a
tomb upon the one hand and a garden of evergreen trees upon the
other.&mdash;&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; says he, with a changed
voice.&nbsp; &lsquo;Let us by all means hurry back to Rome.&nbsp;
I fear you are not well in health.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Oh, for
God&rsquo;s sake!&rsquo; cries the count, shuddering, &lsquo;back
to Rome and let me get to bed.&rsquo;&nbsp; They made their
return with scarce a word; and the count, who should by rights
have gone into society, took to his bed and gave out he had a
touch of country fever.&nbsp; The next day the baron&rsquo;s
horse was found tied to the pine, but himself was never heard of
from that hour.&mdash;And, now, was that a murder?&rdquo; says
the Master, breaking sharply off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure he was a count?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not certain of the title,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;but he was a gentleman of family: and the Lord deliver
you, Mackellar, from an enemy so subtile!&rdquo;</p>
<p>These last words he spoke down at me, smiling, from high
above; the next, he was under my feet.&nbsp; I continued to
follow his evolutions with a childish fixity; they made me giddy
and vacant, and I spoke as in a dream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He hated the baron with a great hatred?&rdquo; I
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His belly moved when the man came near him,&rdquo; said
the Master.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have felt that same,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Verily!&rdquo; cries the Master.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here is
news indeed!&nbsp; I wonder&mdash;do I flatter myself? or am I
the cause of these ventral perturbations?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was quite capable of choosing out a graceful posture, even
with no one to behold him but myself, and all the more if there
were any element of peril.&nbsp; He sat now with one knee flung
across the other, his arms on his bosom, fitting the swing of the
ship with an exquisite balance, such as a featherweight might
overthrow.&nbsp; All at once I had the vision of my lord at the
table, with his head upon his hands; only now, when he showed me
his countenance, it was heavy with reproach.&nbsp; The words of
my own prayer&mdash;<i>I were liker a man if I struck this
creature down</i>&mdash;shot at the same time into my
memory.&nbsp; I called my energies together, and (the ship then
heeling downward toward my enemy) thrust at him swiftly with my
foot.&nbsp; It was written I should have the guilt of this
attempt without the profit.&nbsp; Whether from my own uncertainty
or his incredible quickness, he escaped the thrust, leaping to
his feet and catching hold at the same moment of a stay.</p>
<p>I do not know how long a time passed by.&nbsp; I lying where I
was upon the deck, overcome with terror and remorse and shame: he
standing with the stay in his hand, backed against the bulwarks,
and regarding me with an expression singularly mingled.&nbsp; At
last he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mackellar,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I make no reproaches,
but I offer you a bargain.&nbsp; On your side, I do not suppose
you desire to have this exploit made public; on mine, I own to
you freely I do not care to draw my breath in a perpetual terror
of assassination by the man I sit at meat with.&nbsp; Promise
me&mdash;but no,&rdquo; says he, breaking off, &ldquo;you are not
yet in the quiet possession of your mind; you might think I had
extorted the promise from your weakness; and I would leave no
door open for casuistry to come in&mdash;that dishonesty of the
conscientious.&nbsp; Take time to meditate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that he made off up the sliding deck like a squirrel, and
plunged into the cabin.&nbsp; About half an hour later he
returned&mdash;I still lying as he had left me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;will you give me your troth
as a Christian, and a faithful servant of my brother&rsquo;s,
that I shall have no more to fear from your attempts?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I give it you,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall require your hand upon it,&rdquo; says he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have the right to make conditions,&rdquo; I
replied, and we shook hands.</p>
<p>He sat down at once in the same place and the old perilous
attitude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on!&rdquo; cried I, covering my eyes.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I cannot bear to see you in that posture.&nbsp; The least
irregularity of the sea might plunge you overboard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are highly inconsistent,&rdquo; he replied,
smiling, but doing as I asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;For all that,
Mackellar, I would have you to know you have risen forty feet in
my esteem.&nbsp; You think I cannot set a price upon
fidelity?&nbsp; But why do you suppose I carry that Secundra Dass
about the world with me?&nbsp; Because he would die or do murder
for me to-morrow; and I love him for it.&nbsp; Well, you may
think it odd, but I like you the better for this
afternoon&rsquo;s performance.&nbsp; I thought you were
magnetised with the Ten Commandments; but no&mdash;God damn my
soul!&rdquo;&mdash;he cries, &ldquo;the old wife has blood in his
body after all!&nbsp; Which does not change the fact,&rdquo; he
continued, smiling again, &ldquo;that you have done well to give
your promise; for I doubt if you would ever shine in your new
trade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I should ask your
pardon and God&rsquo;s for my attempt.&nbsp; At any rate, I have
passed my word, which I will keep faithfully.&nbsp; But when I
think of those you persecute&mdash;&rdquo; I paused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Life is a singular thing,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and
mankind a very singular people.&nbsp; You suppose yourself to
love my brother.&nbsp; I assure you, it is merely custom.&nbsp;
Interrogate your memory; and when first you came to Durrisdeer,
you will find you considered him a dull, ordinary youth.&nbsp; He
is as dull and ordinary now, though not so young.&nbsp; Had you
instead fallen in with me, you would to-day be as strong upon my
side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would never say you were ordinary, Mr. Bally,&rdquo;
I returned; &ldquo;but here you prove yourself dull.&nbsp; You
have just shown your reliance on my word.&nbsp; In other terms,
that is my conscience&mdash;the same which starts instinctively
back from you, like the eye from a strong light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;but I mean otherwise.&nbsp;
I mean, had I met you in my youth.&nbsp; You are to consider I
was not always as I am to-day; nor (had I met in with a friend of
your description) should I have ever been so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hut, Mr. Bally,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;you would have
made a mock of me; you would never have spent ten civil words on
such a Square-toes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he was now fairly started on his new course of
justification, with which he wearied me throughout the remainder
of the passage.&nbsp; No doubt in the past he had taken pleasure
to paint himself unnecessarily black, and made a vaunt of his
wickedness, bearing it for a coat-of-arms.&nbsp; Nor was he so
illogical as to abate one item of his old confessions.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But now that I know you are a human being,&rdquo; he would
say, &ldquo;I can take the trouble to explain myself.&nbsp; For I
assure you I am human, too, and have my virtues, like my
neighbours.&rdquo;&nbsp; I say, he wearied me, for I had only the
one word to say in answer: twenty times I must have said it:
&ldquo;Give up your present purpose and return with me to
Durrisdeer; then I will believe you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon he would shake his head at me.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah!
Mackellar, you might live a thousand years and never understand
my nature,&rdquo; he would say.&nbsp; &ldquo;This battle is now
committed, the hour of reflection quite past, the hour for mercy
not yet come.&nbsp; It began between us when we span a coin in
the hall of Durrisdeer, now twenty years ago; we have had our ups
and downs, but never either of us dreamed of giving in; and as
for me, when my glove is cast, life and honour go with
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fig for your honour!&rdquo; I would say.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And by your leave, these warlike similitudes are something
too high-sounding for the matter in hand.&nbsp; You want some
dirty money; there is the bottom of your contention; and as for
your means, what are they? to stir up sorrow in a family that
never harmed you, to debauch (if you can) your own nephew, and to
wring the heart of your born brother!&nbsp; A footpad that kills
an old granny in a woollen mutch with a dirty bludgeon, and that
for a shilling-piece and a paper of snuff&mdash;there is all the
warrior that you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When I would attack him thus (or somewhat thus) he would
smile, and sigh like a man misunderstood.&nbsp; Once, I remember,
he defended himself more at large, and had some curious
sophistries, worth repeating, for a light upon his character.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are very like a civilian to think war consists in
drums and banners,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;War (as the
ancients said very wisely) is <i>ultima ratio</i>.&nbsp; When we
take our advantage unrelentingly, then we make war.&nbsp; Ah!
Mackellar, you are a devil of a soldier in the steward&rsquo;s
room at Durrisdeer, or the tenants do you sad
injustice!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think little of what war is or is not,&rdquo; I
replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;But you weary me with claiming my
respect.&nbsp; Your brother is a good man, and you are a bad
one&mdash;neither more nor less.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had I been Alexander&mdash;&rdquo; he began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is so we all dupe ourselves,&rdquo; I cried.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Had I been St. Paul, it would have been all one; I would
have made the same hash of that career that you now see me making
of my own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you,&rdquo; he cried, bearing down my
interruption, &ldquo;had I been the least petty chieftain in the
Highlands, had I been the least king of naked negroes in the
African desert, my people would have adored me.&nbsp; A bad man,
am I?&nbsp; Ah! but I was born for a good tyrant!&nbsp; Ask
Secundra Dass; he will tell you I treat him like a son.&nbsp;
Cast in your lot with me to-morrow, become my slave, my chattel,
a thing I can command as I command the powers of my own limbs and
spirit&mdash;you will see no more that dark side that I turn upon
the world in anger.&nbsp; I must have all or none.&nbsp; But
where all is given, I give it back with usury.&nbsp; I have a
kingly nature: there is my loss!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has been hitherto rather the loss of others,&rdquo;
I remarked, &ldquo;which seems a little on the hither side of
royalty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tilly-vally!&rdquo; cried he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Even now, I
tell you, I would spare that family in which you take so great an
interest: yes, even now&mdash;to-morrow I would leave them to
their petty welfare, and disappear in that forest of cut-throats
and thimble-riggers that we call the world.&nbsp; I would do it
to-morrow!&rdquo; says he.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Only&mdash;only&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only what?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only they must beg it on their bended knees.&nbsp; I
think in public, too,&rdquo; he added, smiling.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Indeed, Mackellar, I doubt if there be a hall big enough
to serve my purpose for that act of reparation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vanity, vanity!&rdquo; I moralised.&nbsp; &ldquo;To
think that this great force for evil should be swayed by the same
sentiment that sets a lassie mincing to her glass!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! there are double words for everything: the word
that swells, the word that belittles; you cannot fight me with a
word!&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;You said the other day that I
relied on your conscience: were I in your humour of detraction, I
might say I built upon your vanity.&nbsp; It is your pretension
to be <i>un homme de parole</i>; &lsquo;tis mine not to accept
defeat.&nbsp; Call it vanity, call it virtue, call it greatness
of soul&mdash;what signifies the expression?&nbsp; But recognise
in each of us a common strain: that we both live for an
idea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It will be gathered from so much familiar talk, and so much
patience on both sides, that we now lived together upon excellent
terms.&nbsp; Such was again the fact, and this time more
seriously than before.&nbsp; Apart from disputations such as that
which I have tried to reproduce, not only consideration reigned,
but, I am tempted to say, even kindness.&nbsp; When I fell sick
(as I did shortly after our great storm), he sat by my berth to
entertain me with his conversation, and treated me with excellent
remedies, which I accepted with security.&nbsp; Himself commented
on the circumstance.&nbsp; &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; says he,
&ldquo;you begin to know me better.&nbsp; A very little while
ago, upon this lonely ship, where no one but myself has any
smattering of science, you would have made sure I had designs
upon your life.&nbsp; And, observe, it is since I found you had
designs upon my own, that I have shown you most respect.&nbsp;
You will tell me if this speaks of a small mind.&rdquo;&nbsp; I
found little to reply.&nbsp; In so far as regarded myself, I
believed him to mean well; I am, perhaps, the more a dupe of his
dissimulation, but I believed (and I still believe) that he
regarded me with genuine kindness.&nbsp; Singular and sad fact!
so soon as this change began, my animosity abated, and these
haunting visions of my master passed utterly away.&nbsp; So that,
perhaps, there was truth in the man&rsquo;s last vaunting word to
me, uttered on the second day of July, when our long voyage was
at last brought almost to an end, and we lay becalmed at the sea
end of the vast harbour of New York, in a gasping heat, which was
presently exchanged for a surprising waterfall of rain.&nbsp; I
stood on the poop, regarding the green shores near at hand, and
now and then the light smoke of the little town, our
destination.&nbsp; And as I was even then devising how to steal a
march on my familiar enemy, I was conscious of a shade of
embarrassment when he approached me with his hand extended.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am now to bid you farewell,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;and that for ever.&nbsp; For now you go among my enemies,
where all your former prejudices will revive.&nbsp; I never yet
failed to charm a person when I wanted; even you, my good
friend&mdash;to call you so for once&mdash;even you have now a
very different portrait of me in your memory, and one that you
will never quite forget.&nbsp; The voyage has not lasted long
enough, or I should have wrote the impression deeper.&nbsp; But
now all is at an end, and we are again at war.&nbsp; Judge by
this little interlude how dangerous I am; and tell those
fools&rdquo;&mdash;pointing with his finger to the
town&mdash;&ldquo;to think twice and thrice before they set me at
defiance.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER X.&mdash;PASSAGES AT NEW YORK.</h2>
<p>I have mentioned I was resolved to steal a march upon the
Master; and this, with the complicity of Captain McMurtrie, was
mighty easily effected: a boat being partly loaded on the one
side of our ship and the Master placed on board of it, the while
a skiff put off from the other, carrying me alone.&nbsp; I had no
more trouble in finding a direction to my lord&rsquo;s house,
whither I went at top speed, and which I found to be on the
outskirts of the place, a very suitable mansion, in a fine
garden, with an extraordinary large barn, byre, and stable, all
in one.&nbsp; It was here my lord was walking when I arrived;
indeed, it had become his chief place of frequentation, and his
mind was now filled with farming.&nbsp; I burst in upon him
breathless, and gave him my news: which was indeed no news at
all, several ships having outsailed the <i>Nonesuch</i> in the
interval.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have been expecting you long,&rdquo; said my lord;
&ldquo;and indeed, of late days, ceased to expect you any
more.&nbsp; I am glad to take your hand again, Mackellar.&nbsp; I
thought you had been at the bottom of the sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! my lord, would God I had!&rdquo; cried I.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Things would have been better for yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in the least,&rdquo; says he, grimly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I could not ask better.&nbsp; There is a long score to
pay, and now&mdash;at last&mdash;I can begin to pay
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I cried out against his security.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;this is not Durrisdeer, and
I have taken my precautions.&nbsp; His reputation awaits him; I
have prepared a welcome for my brother.&nbsp; Indeed, fortune has
served me; for I found here a merchant of Albany who knew him
after the &rsquo;45 and had mighty convenient suspicions of a
murder: some one of the name of Chew it was, another
Albanian.&nbsp; No one here will be surprised if I deny him my
door; he will not be suffered to address my children, nor even to
salute my wife: as for myself, I make so much exception for a
brother that he may speak to me.&nbsp; I should lose my pleasure
else,&rdquo; says my lord, rubbing his palms.</p>
<p>Presently he bethought himself, and set men off running, with
billets, to summon the magnates of the province.&nbsp; I cannot
recall what pretext he employed; at least, it was successful; and
when our ancient enemy appeared upon the scene, he found my lord
pacing in front of his house under some trees of shade, with the
Governor upon one hand and various notables upon the other.&nbsp;
My lady, who was seated in the verandah, rose with a very pinched
expression and carried her children into the house.</p>
<p>The Master, well dressed and with an elegant walking-sword,
bowed to the company in a handsome manner and nodded to my lord
with familiarity.&nbsp; My lord did not accept the salutation,
but looked upon his brother with bended brows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; says he, at last, &ldquo;what ill
wind brings you hither of all places, where (to our common
disgrace) your reputation has preceded you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your lordship is pleased to be civil,&rdquo; said the
Master, with a fine start.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am pleased to be very plain,&rdquo; returned my lord;
&ldquo;because it is needful you should clearly understand your
situation.&nbsp; At home, where you were so little known, it was
still possible to keep appearances; that would be quite vain in
this province; and I have to tell you that I am quite resolved to
wash my hands of you.&nbsp; You have already ruined me almost to
the door, as you ruined my father before me;&mdash;whose heart
you also broke.&nbsp; Your crimes escape the law; but my friend
the Governor has promised protection to my family.&nbsp; Have a
care, sir!&rdquo; cries my lord, shaking his cane at him:
&ldquo;if you are observed to utter two words to any of my
innocent household, the law shall be stretched to make you smart
for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; says the Master, very slowly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And so this is the advantage of a foreign land!&nbsp;
These gentlemen are unacquainted with our story, I
perceive.&nbsp; They do not know that I am the Lord Durrisdeer;
they do not know you are my younger brother, sitting in my place
under a sworn family compact; they do not know (or they would not
be seen with you in familiar correspondence) that every acre is
mine before God Almighty&mdash;and every doit of the money you
withhold from me, you do it as a thief, a perjurer, and a
disloyal brother!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;General Clinton,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;do not listen
to his lies.&nbsp; I am the steward of the estate, and there is
not one word of truth in it.&nbsp; The man is a forfeited rebel
turned into a hired spy: there is his story in two
words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was thus that (in the heat of the moment) I let slip his
infamy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fellow,&rdquo; said the Governor, turning his face
sternly on the Master, &ldquo;I know more of you than you think
for.&nbsp; We have some broken ends of your adventures in the
provinces, which you will do very well not to drive me to
investigate.&nbsp; There is the disappearance of Mr. Jacob Chew
with all his merchandise; there is the matter of where you came
ashore from with so much money and jewels, when you were picked
up by a Bermudan out of Albany.&nbsp; Believe me, if I let these
matters lie, it is in commiseration for your family and out of
respect for my valued friend, Lord Durrisdeer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a murmur of applause from the provincials.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should have remembered how a title would shine out in
such a hole as this,&rdquo; says the Master, white as a sheet:
&ldquo;no matter how unjustly come by.&nbsp; It remains for me,
then, to die at my lord&rsquo;s door, where my dead body will
form a very cheerful ornament.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Away with your affectations!&rdquo; cries my
lord.&nbsp; &ldquo;You know very well I have no such meaning;
only to protect myself from calumny, and my home from your
intrusion.&nbsp; I offer you a choice.&nbsp; Either I shall pay
your passage home on the first ship, when you may perhaps be able
to resume your occupations under Government, although God knows I
would rather see you on the highway!&nbsp; Or, if that likes you
not, stay here and welcome!&nbsp; I have inquired the least sum
on which body and soul can be decently kept together in New York;
so much you shall have, paid weekly; and if you cannot labour
with your hands to better it, high time you should betake
yourself to learn.&nbsp; The condition is&mdash;that you speak
with no member of my family except myself,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>I do not think I have ever seen any man so pale as was the
Master; but he was erect and his mouth firm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been met here with some very unmerited
insults,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;from which I have certainly no
idea to take refuge by flight.&nbsp; Give me your pittance; I
take it without shame, for it is mine already&mdash;like the
shirt upon your back; and I choose to stay until these gentlemen
shall understand me better.&nbsp; Already they must spy the
cloven hoof, since with all your pretended eagerness for the
family honour, you take a pleasure to degrade it in my
person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is all very fine,&rdquo; says my lord; &ldquo;but
to us who know you of old, you must be sure it signifies
nothing.&nbsp; You take that alternative out of which you think
that you can make the most.&nbsp; Take it, if you can, in
silence; it will serve you better in the long run, you may
believe me, than this ostentation of ingratitude.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, gratitude, my lord!&rdquo; cries the Master, with a
mounting intonation and his forefinger very conspicuously lifted
up.&nbsp; &ldquo;Be at rest: it will not fail you.&nbsp; It now
remains that I should salute these gentlemen whom we have wearied
with our family affairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he bowed to each in succession, settled his walking-sword,
and took himself off, leaving every one amazed at his behaviour,
and me not less so at my lord&rsquo;s.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>We were now to enter on a changed phase of this family
division.&nbsp; The Master was by no manner of means so helpless
as my lord supposed, having at his hand, and entirely devoted to
his service, an excellent artist in all sorts of goldsmith
work.&nbsp; With my lord&rsquo;s allowance, which was not so
scanty as he had described it, the pair could support life; and
all the earnings of Secundra Dass might be laid upon one side for
any future purpose.&nbsp; That this was done, I have no
doubt.&nbsp; It was in all likelihood the Master&rsquo;s design
to gather a sufficiency, and then proceed in quest of that
treasure which he had buried long before among the mountains; to
which, if he had confined himself, he would have been more
happily inspired.&nbsp; But unfortunately for himself and all of
us, he took counsel of his anger.&nbsp; The public disgrace of
his arrival&mdash;which I sometimes wonder he could manage to
survive&mdash;rankled in his bones; he was in that humour when a
man&mdash;in the words of the old adage&mdash;will cut off his
nose to spite his face; and he must make himself a public
spectacle in the hopes that some of the disgrace might spatter on
my lord.</p>
<p>He chose, in a poor quarter of the town, a lonely, small house
of boards, overhung with some acacias.&nbsp; It was furnished in
front with a sort of hutch opening, like that of a dog&rsquo;s
kennel, but about as high as a table from the ground, in which
the poor man that built it had formerly displayed some wares; and
it was this which took the Master&rsquo;s fancy and possibly
suggested his proceedings.&nbsp; It appears, on board the pirate
ship he had acquired some quickness with the needle&mdash;enough,
at least, to play the part of tailor in the public eye; which was
all that was required by the nature of his vengeance.&nbsp; A
placard was hung above the hutch, bearing these words in
something of the following disposition:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">James Durie</span>,</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">formerly</span>
MASTER <span class="smcap">of</span> BALLANTRAE.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Clothes Neatly
Clouted</span>.</p>
<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="text-align: center">SECUNDRA DASS,</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Decayed
Gentleman of India</span>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Fine Goldsmith
Work</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Underneath this, when he had a job, my gentleman sat
withinside tailor-wise and busily stitching.&nbsp; I say, when he
had a job; but such customers as came were rather for Secundra,
and the Master&rsquo;s sewing would be more in the manner of
Penelope&rsquo;s.&nbsp; He could never have designed to gain even
butter to his bread by such a means of livelihood: enough for him
that there was the name of Durie dragged in the dirt on the
placard, and the sometime heir of that proud family set up
cross-legged in public for a reproach upon his brother&rsquo;s
meanness.&nbsp; And in so far his device succeeded that there was
murmuring in the town and a party formed highly inimical to my
lord.&nbsp; My lord&rsquo;s favour with the Governor laid him
more open on the other side; my lady (who was never so well
received in the colony) met with painful innuendoes; in a party
of women, where it would be the topic most natural to introduce,
she was almost debarred from the naming of needle-work; and I
have seen her return with a flushed countenance and vow that she
would go abroad no more.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile my lord dwelled in his decent mansion,
immersed in farming; a popular man with his intimates, and
careless or unconscious of the rest.&nbsp; He laid on flesh; had
a bright, busy face; even the heat seemed to prosper with him;
and my lady&mdash;in despite of her own annoyances&mdash;daily
blessed Heaven her father should have left her such a
paradise.&nbsp; She had looked on from a window upon the
Master&rsquo;s humiliation; and from that hour appeared to feel
at ease.&nbsp; I was not so sure myself; as time went on, there
seemed to me a something not quite wholesome in my lord&rsquo;s
condition.&nbsp; Happy he was, beyond a doubt, but the grounds of
this felicity were wont; even in the bosom of his family he
brooded with manifest delight upon some private thought; and I
conceived at last the suspicion (quite unworthy of us both) that
he kept a mistress somewhere in the town.&nbsp; Yet he went
little abroad, and his day was very fully occupied; indeed, there
was but a single period, and that pretty early in the morning,
while Mr. Alexander was at his lesson-book, of which I was not
certain of the disposition.&nbsp; It should be borne in mind, in
the defence of that which I now did, that I was always in some
fear my lord was not quite justly in his reason; and with our
enemy sitting so still in the same town with us, I did well to be
upon my guard.&nbsp; Accordingly I made a pretext, had the hour
changed at which I taught Mr. Alexander the foundation of
cyphering and the mathematic, and set myself instead to dog my
master&rsquo;s footsteps.</p>
<p>Every morning, fair or foul, he took his gold-headed cane, set
his hat on the back of his head&mdash;a recent habitude, which I
thought to indicate a burning brow&mdash;and betook himself to
make a certain circuit.&nbsp; At the first his way was among
pleasant trees and beside a graveyard, where he would sit awhile,
if the day were fine, in meditation.&nbsp; Presently the path
turned down to the waterside, and came back along the
harbour-front and past the Master&rsquo;s booth.&nbsp; As he
approached this second part of his circuit, my Lord Durrisdeer
began to pace more leisurely, like a man delighted with the air
and scene; and before the booth, half-way between that and the
water&rsquo;s edge, would pause a little, leaning on his
staff.&nbsp; It was the hour when the Master sate within upon his
board and plied his needle.&nbsp; So these two brothers would
gaze upon each other with hard faces; and then my lord move on
again, smiling to himself.</p>
<p>It was but twice that I must stoop to that ungrateful
necessity of playing spy.&nbsp; I was then certain of my
lord&rsquo;s purpose in his rambles and of the secret source of
his delight.&nbsp; Here was his mistress: it was hatred and not
love that gave him healthful colours.&nbsp; Some moralists might
have been relieved by the discovery; I confess that I was
dismayed.&nbsp; I found this situation of two brethren not only
odious in itself, but big with possibilities of further evil; and
I made it my practice, in so far as many occupations would allow,
to go by a shorter path and be secretly present at their
meeting.&nbsp; Coming down one day a little late, after I had
been near a week prevented, I was struck with surprise to find a
new development.&nbsp; I should say there was a bench against the
Master&rsquo;s house, where customers might sit to parley with
the shopman; and here I found my lord seated, nursing his cane
and looking pleasantly forth upon the bay.&nbsp; Not three feet
from him sate the Master, stitching.&nbsp; Neither spoke; nor (in
this new situation) did my lord so much as cut a glance upon his
enemy.&nbsp; He tasted his neighbourhood, I must suppose, less
indirectly in the bare proximity of person; and, without doubt,
drank deep of hateful pleasures.</p>
<p>He had no sooner come away than I openly joined him.&nbsp;
&ldquo;My lord, my lord,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;this is no manner
of behaviour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I grow fat upon it,&rdquo; he replied; and not merely
the words, which were strange enough, but the whole character of
his expression, shocked me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I warn you, my lord, against this indulgency of evil
feeling,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;I know not to which it is
more perilous, the soul or the reason; but you go the way to
murder both.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You cannot understand,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
had never such mountains of bitterness upon your
heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if it were no more,&rdquo; I added, &ldquo;you will
surely goad the man to some extremity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the contrary; I am breaking his spirit,&rdquo; says
my lord.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Every morning for hard upon a week my lord took his same place
upon the bench.&nbsp; It was a pleasant place, under the green
acacias, with a sight upon the bay and shipping, and a sound
(from some way off) of marines singing at their employ.&nbsp;
Here the two sate without speech or any external movement, beyond
that of the needle or the Master biting off a thread, for he
still clung to his pretence of industry; and here I made a point
to join them, wondering at myself and my companions.&nbsp; If any
of my lord&rsquo;s friends went by, he would hail them
cheerfully, and cry out he was there to give some good advice to
his brother, who was now (to his delight) grown quite
industrious.&nbsp; And even this the Master accepted with a
steady countenance; what was in his mind, God knows, or perhaps
Satan only.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, on a still day of what they call the Indian
Summer, when the woods were changed into gold and pink and
scarlet, the Master laid down his needle and burst into a fit of
merriment.&nbsp; I think he must have been preparing it a long
while in silence, for the note in itself was pretty naturally
pitched; but breaking suddenly from so extreme a silence, and in
circumstances so averse from mirth, it sounded ominously on my
ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Henry,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I have for once made a
false step, and for once you have had the wit to profit by
it.&nbsp; The farce of the cobbler ends to-day; and I confess to
you (with my compliments) that you have had the best of it.&nbsp;
Blood will out; and you have certainly a choice idea of how to
make yourself unpleasant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Never a word said my lord; it was just as though the Master
had not broken silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; resumed the Master, &ldquo;do not be
sulky; it will spoil your attitude.&nbsp; You can now afford
(believe me) to be a little gracious; for I have not merely a
defeat to accept.&nbsp; I had meant to continue this performance
till I had gathered enough money for a certain purpose; I confess
ingenuously, I have not the courage.&nbsp; You naturally desire
my absence from this town; I have come round by another way to
the same idea.&nbsp; And I have a proposition to make; or, if
your lordship prefers, a favour to ask.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ask it,&rdquo; says my lord.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may have heard that I had once in this country a
considerable treasure,&rdquo; returned the Master; &ldquo;it
matters not whether or no&mdash;such is the fact; and I was
obliged to bury it in a spot of which I have sufficient
indications.&nbsp; To the recovery of this, has my ambition now
come down; and, as it is my own, you will not grudge it
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go and get it,&rdquo; says my lord.&nbsp; &ldquo;I make
no opposition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the Master; &ldquo;but to do so, I
must find men and carriage.&nbsp; The way is long and rough, and
the country infested with wild Indians.&nbsp; Advance me only so
much as shall be needful: either as a lump sum, in lieu of my
allowance; or, if you prefer it, as a loan, which I shall repay
on my return.&nbsp; And then, if you so decide, you may have seen
the last of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My lord stared him steadily in the eyes; there was a hard
smile upon his face, but he uttered nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Henry,&rdquo; said the Master, with a formidable
quietness, and drawing at the same time somewhat
back&mdash;&ldquo;Henry, I had the honour to address
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us be stepping homeward,&rdquo; says my lord to me,
who was plucking at his sleeve; and with that he rose, stretched
himself, settled his hat, and still without a syllable of
response, began to walk steadily along the shore.</p>
<p>I hesitated awhile between the two brothers, so serious a
climax did we seem to have reached.&nbsp; But the Master had
resumed his occupation, his eyes lowered, his hand seemingly as
deft as ever; and I decided to pursue my lord.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you mad?&rdquo; I cried, so soon as I had overtook
him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Would you cast away so fair an
opportunity?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it possible you should still believe in him?&rdquo;
inquired my lord, almost with a sneer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish him forth of this town!&rdquo; I cried.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I wish him anywhere and anyhow but as he is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have said my say,&rdquo; returned my lord, &ldquo;and
you have said yours.&nbsp; There let it rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But I was bent on dislodging the Master.&nbsp; That sight of
him patiently returning to his needlework was more than my
imagination could digest.&nbsp; There was never a man made, and
the Master the least of any, that could accept so long a series
of insults.&nbsp; The air smelt blood to me.&nbsp; And I vowed
there should be no neglect of mine if, through any chink of
possibility, crime could be yet turned aside.&nbsp; That same
day, therefore, I came to my lord in his business room, where he
sat upon some trivial occupation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I have found a suitable
investment for my small economies.&nbsp; But these are unhappily
in Scotland; it will take some time to lift them, and the affair
presses.&nbsp; Could your lordship see his way to advance me the
amount against my note?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He read me awhile with keen eyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have never
inquired into the state of your affairs, Mackellar,&rdquo; says
he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Beyond the amount of your caution, you may not
be worth a farthing, for what I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been a long while in your service, and never
told a lie, nor yet asked a favour for myself,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;until to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A favour for the Master,&rdquo; he returned,
quietly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you take me for a fool, Mackellar?&nbsp;
Understand it once and for all, I treat this beast in my own way;
fear nor favour shall not move me; and before I am hoodwinked, it
will require a trickster less transparent than yourself.&nbsp; I
ask service, loyal service; not that you should make and mar
behind my back, and steal my own money to defeat me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;these are very
unpardonable expressions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think once more, Mackellar,&rdquo; he replied;
&ldquo;and you will see they fit the fact.&nbsp; It is your own
subterfuge that is unpardonable.&nbsp; Deny (if you can) that you
designed this money to evade my orders with, and I will ask your
pardon freely.&nbsp; If you cannot, you must have the resolution
to hear your conduct go by its own name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you think I had any design but to save
you&mdash;&rdquo; I began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! my old friend,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you know very
well what I think!&nbsp; Here is my hand to you with all my
heart; but of money, not one rap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Defeated upon this side, I went straight to my room, wrote a
letter, ran with it to the harbour, for I knew a ship was on the
point of sailing; and came to the Master&rsquo;s door a little
before dusk.&nbsp; Entering without the form of any knock, I
found him sitting with his Indian at a simple meal of maize
porridge with some milk.&nbsp; The house within was clean and
poor; only a few books upon a shelf distinguished it, and (in one
corner) Secundra&rsquo;s little bench.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Bally,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I have near five
hundred pounds laid by in Scotland, the economies of a hard
life.&nbsp; A letter goes by yon ship to have it lifted.&nbsp;
Have so much patience till the return ship comes in, and it is
all yours, upon the same condition you offered to my lord this
morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rose from the table, came forward, took me by the
shoulders, and looked me in the face, smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet you are very fond of money!&rdquo; said
he.&nbsp; &ldquo;And yet you love money beyond all things else,
except my brother!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fear old age and poverty,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;which
is another matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will never quarrel for a name.&nbsp; Call it
so,&rdquo; he replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah!&nbsp; Mackellar,
Mackellar, if this were done from any love to me, how gladly
would I close upon your offer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; I eagerly answered&mdash;&ldquo;I say
it to my shame, but I cannot see you in this poor place without
compunction.&nbsp; It is not my single thought, nor my first; and
yet it&rsquo;s there!&nbsp; I would gladly see you
delivered.&nbsp; I do not offer it in love, and far from that;
but, as God judges me&mdash;and I wonder at it too!&mdash;quite
without enmity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; says he, still holding my shoulders, and now
gently shaking me, &ldquo;you think of me more than you
suppose.&nbsp; &lsquo;And I wonder at it too,&rsquo;&rdquo; he
added, repeating my expression and, I suppose, something of my
voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;You are an honest man, and for that cause I
spare you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spare me?&rdquo; I cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spare you,&rdquo; he repeated, letting me go and
turning away.&nbsp; And then, fronting me once more.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You little know what I would do with it, Mackellar!&nbsp;
Did you think I had swallowed my defeat indeed?&nbsp; Listen: my
life has been a series of unmerited cast-backs.&nbsp; That fool,
Prince Charlie, mismanaged a most promising affair: there fell my
first fortune.&nbsp; In Paris I had my foot once more high upon
the ladder: that time it was an accident; a letter came to the
wrong hand, and I was bare again.&nbsp; A third time, I found my
opportunity; I built up a place for myself in India with an
infinite patience; and then Clive came, my rajah was swallowed
up, and I escaped out of the convulsion, like another
&AElig;neas, with Secundra Dass upon my back.&nbsp; Three times I
have had my hand upon the highest station: and I am not yet
three-and-forty.&nbsp; I know the world as few men know it when
they come to die&mdash;Court and camp, the East and the West; I
know where to go, I see a thousand openings.&nbsp; I am now at
the height of my resources, sound of health, of inordinate
ambition.&nbsp; Well, all this I resign; I care not if I die, and
the world never hear of me; I care only for one thing, and that I
will have.&nbsp; Mind yourself; lest, when the roof falls, you,
too, should be crushed under the ruins.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>As I came out of his house, all hope of intervention quite
destroyed, I was aware of a stir on the harbour-side, and,
raising my eyes, there was a great ship newly come to
anchor.&nbsp; It seems strange I could have looked upon her with
so much indifference, for she brought death to the brothers of
Durrisdeer.&nbsp; After all the desperate episodes of this
contention, the insults, the opposing interests, the fraternal
duel in the shrubbery, it was reserved for some poor devil in
Grub Street, scribbling for his dinner, and not caring what he
scribbled, to cast a spell across four thousand miles of the salt
sea, and send forth both these brothers into savage and wintry
deserts, there to die.&nbsp; But such a thought was distant from
my mind; and while all the provincials were fluttered about me by
the unusual animation of their port, I passed throughout their
midst on my return homeward, quite absorbed in the recollection
of my visit and the Master&rsquo;s speech.</p>
<p>The same night there was brought to us from the ship a little
packet of pamphlets.&nbsp; The next day my lord was under
engagement to go with the Governor upon some party of pleasure;
the time was nearly due, and I left him for a moment alone in his
room and skimming through the pamphlets.&nbsp; When I returned,
his head had fallen upon the table, his arms lying abroad amongst
the crumpled papers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My lord, my lord!&rdquo; I cried as I ran forward, for
I supposed he was in some fit.</p>
<p>He sprang up like a figure upon wires, his countenance
deformed with fury, so that in a strange place I should scarce
have known him.&nbsp; His hand at the same time flew above his
head, as though to strike me down.&nbsp; &ldquo;Leave me
alone!&rdquo; he screeched, and I fled, as fast as my shaking
legs would bear me, for my lady.&nbsp; She, too, lost no time;
but when we returned, he had the door locked within, and only
cried to us from the other side to leave him be.&nbsp; We looked
in each other&rsquo;s faces, very white&mdash;each supposing the
blow had come at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will write to the Governor to excuse him,&rdquo; says
she.&nbsp; &ldquo;We must keep our strong friends.&rdquo;&nbsp;
But when she took up the pen, it flew out of her fingers.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I cannot write,&rdquo; said she.&nbsp; &ldquo;Can
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will make a shift, my lady,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>She looked over me as I wrote.&nbsp; &ldquo;That will
do,&rdquo; she said, when I had done.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thank God,
Mackellar, I have you to lean upon!&nbsp; But what can it be
now?&nbsp; What, what can it be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In my own mind, I believed there was no explanation possible,
and none required; it was my fear that the man&rsquo;s madness
had now simply burst forth its way, like the long-smothered
flames of a volcano; but to this (in mere mercy to my lady) I
durst not give expression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is more to the purpose to consider our own
behaviour,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Must we leave him there
alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not dare disturb him,&rdquo; she replied.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Nature may know best; it may be Nature that cries to be
alone; and we grope in the dark.&nbsp; Oh yes, I would leave him
as he is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will, then, despatch this letter, my lady, and return
here, if you please, to sit with you,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray do,&rdquo; cries my lady.</p>
<p>All afternoon we sat together, mostly in silence, watching my
lord&rsquo;s door.&nbsp; My own mind was busy with the scene that
had just passed, and its singular resemblance to my vision.&nbsp;
I must say a word upon this, for the story has gone abroad with
great exaggeration, and I have even seen it printed, and my own
name referred to for particulars.&nbsp; So much was the same:
here was my lord in a room, with his head upon the table, and
when he raised his face, it wore such an expression as distressed
me to the soul.&nbsp; But the room was different, my lord&rsquo;s
attitude at the table not at all the same, and his face, when he
disclosed it, expressed a painful degree of fury instead of that
haunting despair which had always (except once, already referred
to) characterised it in the vision.&nbsp; There is the whole
truth at last before the public; and if the differences be great,
the coincidence was yet enough to fill me with uneasiness.&nbsp;
All afternoon, as I say, I sat and pondered upon this quite to
myself; for my lady had trouble of her own, and it was my last
thought to vex her with fancies.&nbsp; About the midst of our
time of waiting, she conceived an ingenious scheme, had Mr.
Alexander fetched, and bid him knock at his father&rsquo;s
door.&nbsp; My lord sent the boy about his business, but without
the least violence, whether of manner or expression; so that I
began to entertain a hope the fit was over.</p>
<p>At last, as the night fell and I was lighting a lamp that
stood there trimmed, the door opened and my lord stood within
upon the threshold.&nbsp; The light was not so strong that we
could read his countenance; when he spoke, methought his voice a
little altered but yet perfectly steady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mackellar,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;carry this note to
its destination with your own hand.&nbsp; It is highly
private.&nbsp; Find the person alone when you deliver
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Henry,&rdquo; says my lady, &ldquo;you are not
ill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; says he, querulously, &ldquo;I am
occupied.&nbsp; Not at all; I am only occupied.&nbsp; It is a
singular thing a man must be supposed to be ill when he has any
business!&nbsp; Send me supper to this room, and a basket of
wine: I expect the visit of a friend.&nbsp; Otherwise I am not to
be disturbed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with that he once more shut himself in.</p>
<p>The note was addressed to one Captain Harris, at a tavern on
the portside.&nbsp; I knew Harris (by reputation) for a dangerous
adventurer, highly suspected of piracy in the past, and now
following the rude business of an Indian trader.&nbsp; What my
lord should have to say to him, or he to my lord, it passed my
imagination to conceive: or yet how my lord had heard of him,
unless by a disgraceful trial from which the man was recently
escaped.&nbsp; Altogether I went upon the errand with reluctance,
and from the little I saw of the captain, returned from it with
sorrow.&nbsp; I found him in a foul-smelling chamber, sitting by
a guttering candle and an empty bottle; he had the remains of a
military carriage, or rather perhaps it was an affectation, for
his manners were low.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell my lord, with my service, that I will wait upon
his lordship in the inside of half an hour,&rdquo; says he, when
he had read the note; and then had the servility, pointing to his
empty bottle, to propose that I should buy him liquor.</p>
<p>Although I returned with my best speed, the Captain followed
close upon my heels, and he stayed late into the night.&nbsp; The
cock was crowing a second time when I saw (from my chamber
window) my lord lighting him to the gate, both men very much
affected with their potations, and sometimes leaning one upon the
other to confabulate.&nbsp; Yet the next morning my lord was
abroad again early with a hundred pounds of money in his
pocket.&nbsp; I never supposed that he returned with it; and yet
I was quite sure it did not find its way to the Master, for I
lingered all morning within view of the booth.&nbsp; That was the
last time my Lord Durrisdeer passed his own enclosure till we
left New York; he walked in his barn, or sat and talked with his
family, all much as usual; but the town saw nothing of him, and
his daily visits to the Master seemed forgotten.&nbsp; Nor yet
did Harris reappear; or not until the end.</p>
<p>I was now much oppressed with a sense of the mysteries in
which we had begun to move.&nbsp; It was plain, if only from his
change of habitude, my lord had something on his mind of a grave
nature; but what it was, whence it sprang, or why he should now
keep the house and garden, I could make no guess at.&nbsp; It was
clear, even to probation, the pamphlets had some share in this
revolution; I read all I could find, and they were all extremely
insignificant, and of the usual kind of party scurrility; even to
a high politician, I could spy out no particular matter of
offence, and my lord was a man rather indifferent on public
questions.&nbsp; The truth is, the pamphlet which was the spring
of this affair, lay all the time on my lord&rsquo;s bosom.&nbsp;
There it was that I found it at last, after he was dead, in the
midst of the north wilderness: in such a place, in such dismal
circumstances, I was to read for the first time these idle, lying
words of a Whig pamphleteer declaiming against indulgency to
Jacobites:&mdash;&ldquo;Another notorious Rebel, the M&mdash;r of
B&mdash;e, is to have his Title restored,&rdquo; the passage
ran.&nbsp; &ldquo;This Business has been long in hand, since he
rendered some very disgraceful Services in Scotland and
France.&nbsp; His Brother, <i>L&mdash;d D&mdash;r</i>, is known
to be no better than himself in Inclination; and the supposed
Heir, who is now to be set aside, was bred up in the most
detestable Principles.&nbsp; In the old Phrase, it is <i>six of
the one and half a dozen of the other</i>; but the Favour of such
a Reposition is too extreme to be passed over.&rdquo;&nbsp; A man
in his right wits could not have cared two straws for a tale so
manifestly false; that Government should ever entertain the
notion, was inconceivable to any reasoning creature, unless
possibly the fool that penned it; and my lord, though never
brilliant, was ever remarkable for sense.&nbsp; That he should
credit such a rodomontade, and carry the pamphlet on his bosom
and the words in his heart, is the clear proof of the man&rsquo;s
lunacy.&nbsp; Doubtless the mere mention of Mr. Alexander, and
the threat directly held out against the child&rsquo;s
succession, precipitated that which had so long impended.&nbsp;
Or else my master had been truly mad for a long time, and we were
too dull or too much used to him, and did not perceive the extent
of his infirmity.</p>
<p>About a week after the day of the pamphlets I was late upon
the harbour-side, and took a turn towards the Master&rsquo;s, as
I often did.&nbsp; The door opened, a flood of light came forth
upon the road, and I beheld a man taking his departure with
friendly salutations.&nbsp; I cannot say how singularly I was
shaken to recognise the adventurer Harris.&nbsp; I could not but
conclude it was the hand of my lord that had brought him there;
and prolonged my walk in very serious and apprehensive
thought.&nbsp; It was late when I came home, and there was my
lord making up his portmanteau for a voyage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you come so late?&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We leave to-morrow for Albany, you and I together; and it
is high time you were about your preparations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For Albany, my lord?&rdquo; I cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;And
for what earthly purpose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Change of scene,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>And my lady, who appeared to have been weeping, gave me the
signal to obey without more parley.&nbsp; She told me a little
later (when we found occasion to exchange some words) that he had
suddenly announced his intention after a visit from Captain
Harris, and her best endeavours, whether to dissuade him from the
journey, or to elicit some explanation of its purpose, had alike
proved unavailing.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XI.&mdash;THE JOURNEY IN THE WILDERNESS.</h2>
<p>We made a prosperous voyage up that fine river of the Hudson,
the weather grateful, the hills singularly beautified with the
colours of the autumn.&nbsp; At Albany we had our residence at an
inn, where I was not so blind and my lord not so cunning but what
I could see he had some design to hold me prisoner.&nbsp; The
work he found for me to do was not so pressing that we should
transact it apart from necessary papers in the chamber of an inn;
nor was it of such importance that I should be set upon as many
as four or five scrolls of the same document.&nbsp; I submitted
in appearance; but I took private measures on my own side, and
had the news of the town communicated to me daily by the
politeness of our host.&nbsp; In this way I received at last a
piece of intelligence for which, I may say, I had been
waiting.&nbsp; Captain Harris (I was told) with &ldquo;Mr.
Mountain, the trader,&rdquo; had gone by up the river in a
boat.&nbsp; I would have feared the landlord&rsquo;s eye, so
strong the sense of some complicity upon my master&rsquo;s part
oppressed me.&nbsp; But I made out to say I had some knowledge of
the Captain, although none of Mr. Mountain, and to inquire who
else was of the party.&nbsp; My informant knew not; Mr. Mountain
had come ashore upon some needful purchases; had gone round the
town buying, drinking, and prating; and it seemed the party went
upon some likely venture, for he had spoken much of great things
he would do when he returned.&nbsp; No more was known, for none
of the rest had come ashore, and it seemed they were pressed for
time to reach a certain spot before the snow should fall.</p>
<p>And sure enough, the next day, there fell a sprinkle even in
Albany; but it passed as it came, and was but a reminder of what
lay before us.&nbsp; I thought of it lightly then, knowing so
little as I did of that inclement province: the retrospect is
different; and I wonder at times if some of the horror of there
events which I must now rehearse flowed not from the foul skies
and savage winds to which we were exposed, and the agony of cold
that we must suffer.</p>
<p>The boat having passed by, I thought at first we should have
left the town.&nbsp; But no such matter.&nbsp; My lord continued
his stay in Albany where he had no ostensible affairs, and kept
me by him, far from my due employment, and making a pretence of
occupation.&nbsp; It is upon this passage I expect, and perhaps
deserve, censure.&nbsp; I was not so dull but what I had my own
thoughts.&nbsp; I could not see the Master entrust himself into
the hands of Harris, and not suspect some underhand
contrivance.&nbsp; Harris bore a villainous reputation, and he
had been tampered with in private by my lord; Mountain, the
trader, proved, upon inquiry, to be another of the same kidney;
the errand they were all gone upon being the recovery of
ill-gotten treasures, offered in itself a very strong incentive
to foul play; and the character of the country where they
journeyed promised impunity to deeds of blood.&nbsp; Well: it is
true I had all these thoughts and fears, and guesses of the
Master&rsquo;s fate.&nbsp; But you are to consider I was the same
man that sought to dash him from the bulwarks of a ship in the
mid-sea; the same that, a little before, very impiously but
sincerely offered God a bargain, seeking to hire God to be my
bravo.&nbsp; It is true again that I had a good deal melted
towards our enemy.&nbsp; But this I always thought of as a
weakness of the flesh and even culpable; my mind remaining steady
and quite bent against him.&nbsp; True, yet again, that it was
one thing to assume on my own shoulders the guilt and danger of a
criminal attempt, and another to stand by and see my lord imperil
and besmirch himself.&nbsp; But this was the very ground of my
inaction.&nbsp; For (should I anyway stir in the business) I
might fail indeed to save the Master, but I could not miss to
make a byword of my lord.</p>
<p>Thus it was that I did nothing; and upon the same reasons, I
am still strong to justify my course.&nbsp; We lived meanwhile in
Albany, but though alone together in a strange place, had little
traffic beyond formal salutations.&nbsp; My lord had carried with
him several introductions to chief people of the town and
neighbourhood; others he had before encountered in New York: with
this consequence, that he went much abroad, and I am sorry to say
was altogether too convivial in his habits.&nbsp; I was often in
bed, but never asleep, when he returned; and there was scarce a
night when he did not betray the influence of liquor.&nbsp; By
day he would still lay upon me endless tasks, which he showed
considerable ingenuity to fish up and renew, in the manner of
Penelope&rsquo;s web.&nbsp; I never refused, as I say, for I was
hired to do his bidding; but I took no pains to keep my
penetration under a bushel, and would sometimes smile in his
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I must be the devil and you Michael
Scott,&rdquo; I said to him one day.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have bridged
Tweed and split the Eildons; and now you set me to the rope of
sand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at me with shining eyes, and looked away again, his
jaw chewing, but without words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well, my lord,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;your will is
my pleasure.&nbsp; I will do this thing for the fourth time; but
I would beg of you to invent another task against to-morrow, for
by my troth, I am weary of this one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do not know what you are saying,&rdquo; returned my
lord, putting on his hat and turning his back to me.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It is a strange thing you should take a pleasure to annoy
me.&nbsp; A friend&mdash;but that is a different affair.&nbsp; It
is a strange thing.&nbsp; I am a man that has had ill-fortune all
my life through.&nbsp; I am still surrounded by
contrivances.&nbsp; I am always treading in plots,&rdquo; he
burst out.&nbsp; &ldquo;The whole world is banded against
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would not talk wicked nonsense if I were you,&rdquo;
said I; &ldquo;but I will tell you what I <i>would</i> do&mdash;I
would put my head in cold water, for you had more last night than
you could carry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do ye think that?&rdquo; said he, with a manner of
interest highly awakened.&nbsp; &ldquo;Would that be good for
me?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a thing I never tried.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mind the days when you had no call to try, and I
wish, my lord, that they were back again,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But the plain truth is, if you continue to exceed, you
will do yourself a mischief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t appear to carry drink the way I used
to,&rdquo; said my lord.&nbsp; &ldquo;I get overtaken,
Mackellar.&nbsp; But I will be more upon my guard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is what I would ask of you,&rdquo; I
replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;You are to bear in mind that you are Mr.
Alexander&rsquo;s father: give the bairn a chance to carry his
name with some responsibility.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;re a very
sensible man, Mackellar, and have been long in my employ.&nbsp;
But I think, if you have nothing more to say to me I will be
stepping.&nbsp; If you have nothing more to say?&rdquo; he added,
with that burning, childish eagerness that was now so common with
the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my lord, I have nothing more,&rdquo; said I, dryly
enough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I think I will be stepping,&rdquo; says my lord,
and stood and looked at me fidgeting with his hat, which he had
taken off again.&nbsp; &ldquo;I suppose you will have no
errands?&nbsp; No?&nbsp; I am to meet Sir William Johnson, but I
will be more upon my guard.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was silent for a
time, and then, smiling: &ldquo;Do you call to mind a place,
Mackellar&mdash;it&rsquo;s a little below Engles&mdash;where the
burn runs very deep under a wood of rowans.&nbsp; I mind being
there when I was a lad&mdash;dear, it comes over me like an old
song!&mdash;I was after the fishing, and I made a bonny
cast.&nbsp; Eh, but I was happy.&nbsp; I wonder, Mackellar, why I
am never happy now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;if you would drink with
more moderation you would have the better chance.&nbsp; It is an
old byword that the bottle is a false consoler.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;no doubt.&nbsp; Well,
I think I will be going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-morning, my lord,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-morning, good-morning,&rdquo; said he, and so got
himself at last from the apartment.</p>
<p>I give that for a fair specimen of my lord in the morning; and
I must have described my patron very ill if the reader does not
perceive a notable falling off.&nbsp; To behold the man thus
fallen: to know him accepted among his companions for a poor,
muddled toper, welcome (if he were welcome at all) for the bare
consideration of his title; and to recall the virtues he had once
displayed against such odds of fortune; was not this a thing at
once to rage and to be humbled at?</p>
<p>In his cups, he was more expensive.&nbsp; I will give but the
one scene, close upon the end, which is strongly marked upon my
memory to this day, and at the time affected me almost with
horror.</p>
<p>I was in bed, lying there awake, when I heard him stumbling on
the stair and singing.&nbsp; My lord had no gift of music, his
brother had all the graces of the family, so that when I say
singing, you are to understand a manner of high, carolling
utterance, which was truly neither speech nor song.&nbsp;
Something not unlike is to be heard upon the lips of children,
ere they learn shame; from those of a man grown elderly, it had a
strange effect.&nbsp; He opened the door with noisy precaution;
peered in, shading his candle; conceived me to slumber; entered,
set his light upon the table, and took off his hat.&nbsp; I saw
him very plain; a high, feverish exultation appeared to boil in
his veins, and he stood and smiled and smirked upon the
candle.&nbsp; Presently he lifted up his arm, snapped his
fingers, and fell to undress.&nbsp; As he did so, having once
more forgot my presence, he took back to his singing; and now I
could hear the words, which were those from the old song of the
<i>Twa Corbies</i> endlessly repeated:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And over his banes when they are bare<br />
The wind sall blaw for evermair!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have said there was no music in the man.&nbsp; His strains
had no logical succession except in so far as they inclined a
little to the minor mode; but they exercised a rude potency upon
the feelings, and followed the words, and signified the feelings
of the singer with barbaric fitness.&nbsp; He took it first in
the time and manner of a rant; presently this ill-favoured
gleefulness abated, he began to dwell upon the notes more
feelingly, and sank at last into a degree of maudlin pathos that
was to me scarce bearable.&nbsp; By equal steps, the original
briskness of his acts declined; and when he was stripped to his
breeches, he sat on the bedside and fell to whimpering.&nbsp; I
know nothing less respectable than the tears of drunkenness, and
turned my back impatiently on this poor sight.</p>
<p>But he had started himself (I am to suppose) on that slippery
descent of self-pity; on the which, to a man unstrung by old
sorrows and recent potations there is no arrest except
exhaustion.&nbsp; His tears continued to flow, and the man to sit
there, three parts naked, in the cold air of the chamber.&nbsp; I
twitted myself alternately with inhumanity and sentimental
weakness, now half rising in my bed to interfere, now reading
myself lessons of indifference and courting slumber, until, upon
a sudden, the <i>quantum mutatus ab illo</i> shot into my mind;
and calling to remembrance his old wisdom, constancy, and
patience, I was overborne with a pity almost approaching the
passionate, not for my master alone but for the sons of man.</p>
<p>At this I leaped from my place, went over to his side and laid
a hand on his bare shoulder, which was cold as stone.&nbsp; He
uncovered his face and showed it me all swollen and begrutten <a
name="citation10"></a><a href="#footnote10"
class="citation">[10]</a> like a child&rsquo;s; and at the sight
my impatience partially revived.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think shame to yourself,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp;
&ldquo;This is bairnly conduct.&nbsp; I might have been
snivelling myself, if I had cared to swill my belly with
wine.&nbsp; But I went to my bed sober like a man.&nbsp; Come:
get into yours, and have done with this pitiable
exhibition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mackellar,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;my heart is
wae!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wae?&rdquo; cried I.&nbsp; &ldquo;For a good cause, I
think.&nbsp; What words were these you sang as you came in?&nbsp;
Show pity to others, we then can talk of pity to yourself.&nbsp;
You can be the one thing or the other, but I will be no party to
half-way houses.&nbsp; If you&rsquo;re a striker, strike, and if
you&rsquo;re a bleater, bleat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cry!&rdquo; cries he, with a burst, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s
it&mdash;strike! that&rsquo;s talking!&nbsp; Man, I&rsquo;ve
stood it all too long.&nbsp; But when they laid a hand upon the
child, when the child&rsquo;s threatened&rdquo;&mdash;his
momentary vigour whimpering off&mdash;&ldquo;my child, my
Alexander!&rdquo;&mdash;and he was at his tears again.</p>
<p>I took him by the shoulders and shook him.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Alexander!&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you even think
of him?&nbsp; Not you!&nbsp; Look yourself in the face like a
brave man, and you&rsquo;ll find you&rsquo;re but a
self-deceiver.&nbsp; The wife, the friend, the child,
they&rsquo;re all equally forgot, and you sunk in a mere log of
selfishness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mackellar,&rdquo; said he, with a wonderful return to
his old manner and appearance, &ldquo;you may say what you will
of me, but one thing I never was&mdash;I was never
selfish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will open your eyes in your despite,&rdquo; said
I.&nbsp; &ldquo;How long have we been here? and how often have
you written to your family?&nbsp; I think this is the first time
you were ever separate: have you written at all?&nbsp; Do they
know if you are dead or living?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had caught him here too openly; it braced his better nature;
there was no more weeping, he thanked me very penitently, got to
bed and was soon fast asleep; and the first thing he did the next
morning was to sit down and begin a letter to my lady: a very
tender letter it was too, though it was never finished.&nbsp;
Indeed all communication with New York was transacted by myself;
and it will be judged I had a thankless task of it.&nbsp; What to
tell my lady and in what words, and how far to be false and how
far cruel, was a thing that kept me often from my slumber.</p>
<p>All this while, no doubt, my lord waited with growing
impatiency for news of his accomplices.&nbsp; Harris, it is to be
thought, had promised a high degree of expedition; the time was
already overpast when word was to be looked for; and suspense was
a very evil counsellor to a man of an impaired
intelligence.&nbsp; My lord&rsquo;s mind throughout this interval
dwelled almost wholly in the Wilderness, following that party
with whose deeds he had so much concern.&nbsp; He continually
conjured up their camps and progresses, the fashion of the
country, the perpetration in a thousand different manners of the
same horrid fact, and that consequent spectacle of the
Master&rsquo;s bones lying scattered in the wind.&nbsp; These
private, guilty considerations I would continually observe to
peep forth in the man&rsquo;s talk, like rabbits from a
hill.&nbsp; And it is the less wonder if the scene of his
meditations began to draw him bodily.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>It is well known what pretext he took.&nbsp; Sir William
Johnson had a diplomatic errand in these parts; and my lord and I
(from curiosity, as was given out) went in his company.&nbsp; Sir
William was well attended and liberally supplied.&nbsp; Hunters
brought us venison, fish was taken for us daily in the streams,
and brandy ran like water.&nbsp; We proceeded by day and encamped
by night in the military style; sentinels were set and changed;
every man had his named duty; and Sir William was the spring of
all.&nbsp; There was much in this that might at times have
entertained me; but for our misfortune, the weather was extremely
harsh, the days were in the beginning open, but the nights frosty
from the first.&nbsp; A painful keen wind blew most of the time,
so that we sat in the boat with blue fingers, and at night, as we
scorched our faces at the fire, the clothes upon our back
appeared to be of paper.&nbsp; A dreadful solitude surrounded our
steps; the land was quite dispeopled, there was no smoke of
fires, and save for a single boat of merchants on the second day,
we met no travellers.&nbsp; The season was indeed late, but this
desertion of the waterways impressed Sir William himself; and I
have heard him more than once express a sense of
intimidation.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have come too late, I fear; they
must have dug up the hatchet;&rdquo; he said; and the future
proved how justly he had reasoned.</p>
<p>I could never depict the blackness of my soul upon this
journey.&nbsp; I have none of those minds that are in love with
the unusual: to see the winter coming and to lie in the field so
far from any house, oppressed me like a nightmare; it seemed,
indeed, a kind of awful braving of God&rsquo;s power; and this
thought, which I daresay only writes me down a coward, was
greatly exaggerated by my private knowledge of the errand we were
come upon.&nbsp; I was besides encumbered by my duties to Sir
William, whom it fell upon me to entertain; for my lord was quite
sunk into a state bordering on <i>pervigilium</i>, watching the
woods with a rapt eye, sleeping scarce at all, and speaking
sometimes not twenty words in a whole day.&nbsp; That which he
said was still coherent; but it turned almost invariably upon the
party for whom he kept his crazy lookout.&nbsp; He would tell Sir
William often, and always as if it were a new communication, that
he had &ldquo;a brother somewhere in the woods,&rdquo; and beg
that the sentinels should be directed &ldquo;to inquire for
him.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I am anxious for news of my
brother,&rdquo; he would say.&nbsp; And sometimes, when we were
under way, he would fancy he spied a canoe far off upon the water
or a camp on the shore, and exhibit painful agitation.&nbsp; It
was impossible but Sir William should be struck with these
singularities; and at last he led me aside, and hinted his
uneasiness.&nbsp; I touched my head and shook it; quite rejoiced
to prepare a little testimony against possible disclosures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But in that case,&rdquo; cries Sir William, &ldquo;is
it wise to let him go at large?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those that know him best,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;are
persuaded that he should be humoured.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; replied Sir William, &ldquo;it is
none of my affairs.&nbsp; But if I had understood, you would
never have been here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our advance into this savage country had thus uneventfully
proceeded for about a week, when we encamped for a night at a
place where the river ran among considerable mountains clothed in
wood.&nbsp; The fires were lighted on a level space at the
water&rsquo;s edge; and we supped and lay down to sleep in the
customary fashion.&nbsp; It chanced the night fell murderously
cold; the stringency of the frost seized and bit me through my
coverings so that pain kept me wakeful; and I was afoot again
before the peep of day, crouching by the fires or trotting to and
for at the stream&rsquo;s edge, to combat the aching of my
limbs.&nbsp; At last dawn began to break upon hoar woods and
mountains, the sleepers rolled in their robes, and the boisterous
river dashing among spears of ice.&nbsp; I stood looking about
me, swaddled in my stiff coat of a bull&rsquo;s fur, and the
breath smoking from my scorched nostrils, when, upon a sudden, a
singular, eager cry rang from the borders of the wood.&nbsp; The
sentries answered it, the sleepers sprang to their feet; one
pointed, the rest followed his direction with their eyes, and
there, upon the edge of the forest and betwixt two trees, we
beheld the figure of a man reaching forth his hands like one in
ecstasy.&nbsp; The next moment he ran forward, fell on his knees
at the side of the camp, and burst in tears.</p>
<p>This was John Mountain, the trader, escaped from the most
horrid perils; and his fist word, when he got speech, was to ask
if we had seen Secundra Dass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seen what?&rdquo; cries Sir William.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;we have seen nothing of
him.&nbsp; Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing?&rdquo; says Mountain.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then I was
right after all.&rdquo;&nbsp; With that he struck his palm upon
his brow.&nbsp; &ldquo;But what takes him back?&rdquo; he
cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;What takes the man back among dead
bodies.&nbsp; There is some damned mystery here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was a word which highly aroused our curiosity, but I
shall be more perspicacious, if I narrate these incidents in
their true order.&nbsp; Here follows a narrative which I have
compiled out of three sources, not very consistent in all
points:</p>
<p><i>First</i>, a written statement by Mountain, in which
everything criminal is cleverly smuggled out of view;</p>
<p><i>Second</i>, two conversations with Secundra Dass; and</p>
<p><i>Third</i>, many conversations with Mountain himself, in
which he was pleased to be entirely plain; for the truth is he
regarded me as an accomplice.</p>
<h3>NARRATIVE OF THE TRADER, MOUNTAIN.</h3>
<p>The crew that went up the river under the joint command of
Captain Harris and the Master numbered in all nine persons, of
whom (if I except Secundra Dass) there was not one that had not
merited the gallows.&nbsp; From Harris downward the voyagers were
notorious in that colony for desperate, bloody-minded miscreants;
some were reputed pirates, the most hawkers of rum; all ranters
and drinkers; all fit associates, embarking together without
remorse, upon this treacherous and murderous design.&nbsp; I
could not hear there was much discipline or any set captain in
the gang; but Harris and four others, Mountain himself, two
Scotchmen&mdash;Pinkerton and Hastie&mdash;and a man of the name
of Hicks, a drunken shoemaker, put their heads together and
agreed upon the course.&nbsp; In a material sense, they were well
enough provided; and the Master in particular brought with him a
tent where he might enjoy some privacy and shelter.</p>
<p>Even this small indulgence told against him in the minds of
his companions.&nbsp; But indeed he was in a position so entirely
false (and even ridiculous) that all his habit of command and
arts of pleasing were here thrown away.&nbsp; In the eyes of all,
except Secundra Dass, he figured as a common gull and designated
victim; going unconsciously to death; yet he could not but
suppose himself the contriver and the leader of the expedition;
he could scarce help but so conduct himself and at the least hint
of authority or condescension, his deceivers would be laughing in
their sleeves.&nbsp; I was so used to see and to conceive him in
a high, authoritative attitude, that when I had conceived his
position on this journey, I was pained and could have
blushed.&nbsp; How soon he may have entertained a first surmise,
we cannot know; but it was long, and the party had advanced into
the Wilderness beyond the reach of any help, ere he was fully
awakened to the truth.</p>
<p>It fell thus.&nbsp; Harris and some others had drawn apart
into the woods for consultation, when they were startled by a
rustling in the brush.&nbsp; They were all accustomed to the arts
of Indian warfare, and Mountain had not only lived and hunted,
but fought and earned some reputation, with the savages.&nbsp; He
could move in the woods without noise, and follow a trail like a
hound; and upon the emergence of this alert, he was deputed by
the rest to plunge into the thicket for intelligence.&nbsp; He
was soon convinced there was a man in his close neighbourhood,
moving with precaution but without art among the leaves and
branches; and coming shortly to a place of advantage, he was able
to observe Secundra Dass crawling briskly off with many backward
glances.&nbsp; At this he knew not whether to laugh or cry; and
his accomplices, when he had returned and reported, were in much
the same dubiety.&nbsp; There was now no danger of an Indian
onslaught; but on the other hand, since Secundra Dass was at the
pains to spy upon them, it was highly probable he knew English,
and if he knew English it was certain the whole of their design
was in the Master&rsquo;s knowledge.&nbsp; There was one
singularity in the position.&nbsp; If Secundra Dass knew and
concealed his knowledge of English, Harris was a proficient in
several of the tongues of India, and as his career in that part
of the world had been a great deal worse than profligate, he had
not thought proper to remark upon the circumstance.&nbsp; Each
side had thus a spy-hole on the counsels of the other.&nbsp; The
plotters, so soon as this advantage was explained, returned to
camp; Harris, hearing the Hindustani was once more closeted with
his master, crept to the side of the tent; and the rest, sitting
about the fire with their tobacco, awaited his report with
impatience.&nbsp; When he came at last, his face was very
black.&nbsp; He had overheard enough to confirm the worst of his
suspicions.&nbsp; Secundra Dass was a good English scholar; he
had been some days creeping and listening, the Master was now
fully informed of the conspiracy, and the pair proposed on the
morrow to fall out of line at a carrying place and plunge at a
venture in the woods: preferring the full risk of famine, savage
beasts, and savage men to their position in the midst of
traitors.</p>
<p>What, then, was to be done?&nbsp; Some were for killing the
Master on the spot; but Harris assured them that would be a crime
without profit, since the secret of the treasure must die along
with him that buried it.&nbsp; Others were for desisting at once
from the whole enterprise and making for New York; but the
appetising name of treasure, and the thought of the long way they
had already travelled dissuaded the majority.&nbsp; I imagine
they were dull fellows for the most part.&nbsp; Harris, indeed,
had some acquirements, Mountain was no fool, Hastie was an
educated man; but even these had manifestly failed in life, and
the rest were the dregs of colonial rascality.&nbsp; The
conclusion they reached, at least, was more the offspring of
greed and hope, than reason.&nbsp; It was to temporise, to be
wary and watch the Master, to be silent and supply no further
aliment to his suspicions, and to depend entirely (as well as I
make out) on the chance that their victim was as greedy, hopeful,
and irrational as themselves, and might, after all, betray his
life and treasure.</p>
<p>Twice in the course of the next day Secundra and the Master
must have appeared to themselves to have escaped; and twice they
were circumvented.&nbsp; The Master, save that the second time he
grew a little pale, displayed no sign of disappointment,
apologised for the stupidity with which he had fallen aside,
thanked his recapturers as for a service, and rejoined the
caravan with all his usual gallantry and cheerfulness of mien and
bearing.&nbsp; But it is certain he had smelled a rat; for from
thenceforth he and Secundra spoke only in each other&rsquo;s ear,
and Harris listened and shivered by the tent in vain.&nbsp; The
same night it was announced they were to leave the boats and
proceed by foot, a circumstance which (as it put an end to the
confusion of the portages) greatly lessened the chances of
escape.</p>
<p>And now there began between the two sides a silent contest,
for life on the one hand, for riches on the other.&nbsp; They
were now near that quarter of the desert in which the Master
himself must begin to play the part of guide; and using this for
a pretext of persecution, Harris and his men sat with him every
night about the fire, and laboured to entrap him into some
admission.&nbsp; If he let slip his secret, he knew well it was
the warrant for his death; on the other hand, he durst not refuse
their questions, and must appear to help them to the best of his
capacity, or he practically published his mistrust.&nbsp; And yet
Mountain assures me the man&rsquo;s brow was never ruffled.&nbsp;
He sat in the midst of these jackals, his life depending by a
thread, like some easy, witty householder at home by his own
fire; an answer he had for everything&mdash;as often as not, a
jesting answer; avoided threats, evaded insults; talked, laughed,
and listened with an open countenance; and, in short, conducted
himself in such a manner as must have disarmed suspicion, and
went near to stagger knowledge.&nbsp; Indeed, Mountain confessed
to me they would soon have disbelieved the Captain&rsquo;s story,
and supposed their designated victim still quite innocent of
their designs; but for the fact that he continued (however
ingeniously) to give the slip to questions, and the yet stronger
confirmation of his repeated efforts to escape.&nbsp; The last of
these, which brought things to a head, I am now to relate.&nbsp;
And first I should say that by this time the temper of
Harris&rsquo;s companions was utterly worn out; civility was
scarce pretended; and for one very significant circumstance, the
Master and Secundra had been (on some pretext) deprived of
weapons.&nbsp; On their side, however, the threatened pair kept
up the parade of friendship handsomely; Secundra was all bows,
the Master all smiles; and on the last night of the truce he had
even gone so far as to sing for the diversion of the
company.&nbsp; It was observed that he had also eaten with
unusual heartiness, and drank deep, doubtless from design.</p>
<p>At least, about three in the morning, he came out of the tent
into the open air, audibly mourning and complaining, with all the
manner of a sufferer from surfeit.&nbsp; For some while, Secundra
publicly attended on his patron, who at last became more easy,
and fell asleep on the frosty ground behind the tent, the Indian
returning within.&nbsp; Some time after, the sentry was changed;
had the Master pointed out to him, where he lay in what is called
a robe of buffalo: and thenceforth kept an eye upon him (he
declared) without remission.&nbsp; With the first of the dawn, a
draught of wind came suddenly and blew open one side the corner
of the robe; and with the same puff, the Master&rsquo;s hat
whirled in the air and fell some yards away.&nbsp; The sentry
thinking it remarkable the sleeper should not awaken, thereupon
drew near; and the next moment, with a great shout, informed the
camp their prisoner was escaped.&nbsp; He had left behind his
Indian, who (in the first vivacity of the surprise) came near to
pay the forfeit of his life, and was, in fact, inhumanly
mishandled; but Secundra, in the midst of threats and cruelties,
stuck to it with extraordinary loyalty, that he was quite
ignorant of his master&rsquo;s plans, which might indeed be true,
and of the manner of his escape, which was demonstrably
false.&nbsp; Nothing was therefore left to the conspirators but
to rely entirely on the skill of Mountain.&nbsp; The night had
been frosty, the ground quite hard; and the sun was no sooner up
than a strong thaw set in.&nbsp; It was Mountain&rsquo;s boast
that few men could have followed that trail, and still fewer
(even of the native Indians) found it.&nbsp; The Master had thus
a long start before his pursuers had the scent, and he must have
travelled with surprising energy for a pedestrian so unused,
since it was near noon before Mountain had a view of him.&nbsp;
At this conjuncture the trader was alone, all his companions
following, at his own request, several hundred yards in the rear;
he knew the Master was unarmed; his heart was besides heated with
the exercise and lust of hunting; and seeing the quarry so close,
so defenceless, and seeming so fatigued, he vain-gloriously
determined to effect the capture with his single hand.&nbsp; A
step or two farther brought him to one margin of a little
clearing; on the other, with his arms folded and his back to a
huge stone, the Master sat.&nbsp; It is possible Mountain may
have made a rustle, it is certain, at least, the Master raised
his head and gazed directly at that quarter of the thicket where
his hunter lay; &ldquo;I could not be sure he saw me,&rdquo;
Mountain said; &ldquo;he just looked my way like a man with his
mind made up, and all the courage ran out of me like rum out of a
bottle.&rdquo;&nbsp; And presently, when the Master looked away
again, and appeared to resume those meditations in which he had
sat immersed before the trader&rsquo;s coming, Mountain slunk
stealthily back and returned to seek the help of his
companions.</p>
<p>And now began the chapter of surprises, for the scout had
scarce informed the others of his discovery, and they were yet
preparing their weapons for a rush upon the fugitive, when the
man himself appeared in their midst, walking openly and quietly,
with his hands behind his back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, men!&rdquo; says he, on his beholding them.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Here is a fortunate encounter.&nbsp; Let us get back to
camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mountain had not mentioned his own weakness or the
Master&rsquo;s disconcerting gaze upon the thicket, so that (with
all the rest) his return appeared spontaneous.&nbsp; For all
that, a hubbub arose; oaths flew, fists were shaken, and guns
pointed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us get back to camp,&rdquo; said the Master.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I have an explanation to make, but it must be laid before
you all.&nbsp; And in the meanwhile I would put up these weapons,
one of which might very easily go off and blow away your hopes of
treasure.&nbsp; I would not kill,&rdquo; says he, smiling,
&ldquo;the goose with the golden eggs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The charm of his superiority once more triumphed; and the
party, in no particular order, set off on their return.&nbsp; By
the way, he found occasion to get a word or two apart with
Mountain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a clever fellow and a bold,&rdquo; says he,
&ldquo;but I am not so sure that you are doing yourself
justice.&nbsp; I would have you to consider whether you would not
do better, ay, and safer, to serve me instead of serving so
commonplace a rascal as Mr. Harris.&nbsp; Consider of it,&rdquo;
he concluded, dealing the man a gentle tap upon the shoulder,
&ldquo;and don&rsquo;t be in haste.&nbsp; Dead or alive, you will
find me an ill man to quarrel with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they were come back to the camp, where Harris and
Pinkerton stood guard over Secundra, these two ran upon the
Master like viragoes, and were amazed out of measure when they
were bidden by their comrades to &ldquo;stand back and hear what
the gentleman had to say.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Master had not
flinched before their onslaught; nor, at this proof of the ground
he had gained, did he betray the least sufficiency.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not let us be in haste,&rdquo; says he.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Meat first and public speaking after.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that they made a hasty meal: and as soon as it was done,
the Master, leaning on one elbow, began his speech.&nbsp; He
spoke long, addressing himself to each except Harris, finding for
each (with the same exception) some particular flattery.&nbsp; He
called them &ldquo;bold, honest blades,&rdquo; declared he had
never seen a more jovial company, work better done, or pains more
merrily supported.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; says he,
&ldquo;some one asks me, Why the devil I ran away?&nbsp; But that
is scarce worth answer, for I think you all know pretty
well.&nbsp; But you know only pretty well: that is a point I
shall arrive at presently, and be you ready to remark it when it
comes.&nbsp; There is a traitor here: a double traitor: I will
give you his name before I am done; and let that suffice for
now.&nbsp; But here comes some other gentleman and asks me,
&lsquo;Why, in the devil, I came back?&rsquo;&nbsp; Well, before
I answer that question, I have one to put to you.&nbsp; It was
this cur here, this Harris, that speaks Hindustani?&rdquo; cries
he, rising on one knee and pointing fair at the man&rsquo;s face,
with a gesture indescribably menacing; and when he had been
answered in the affirmative, &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; says he,
&ldquo;then are all my suspicions verified, and I did rightly to
come back.&nbsp; Now, men, hear the truth for the first
time.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thereupon he launched forth in a long story,
told with extraordinary skill, how he had all along suspected
Harris, how he had found the confirmation of his fears, and how
Harris must have misrepresented what passed between Secundra and
himself.&nbsp; At this point he made a bold stroke with excellent
effect.&nbsp; &ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;you think
you are going shares with Harris; I suppose you think you will
see to that yourselves; you would naturally not think so flat a
rogue could cozen you.&nbsp; But have a care!&nbsp; These half
idiots have a sort of cunning, as the skunk has its stench; and
it may be news to you that Harris has taken care of himself
already.&nbsp; Yes, for him the treasure is all money in the
bargain.&nbsp; You must find it or go starve.&nbsp; But he has
been paid beforehand; my brother paid him to destroy me; look at
him, if you doubt&mdash;look at him, grinning and gulping, a
detected thief!&rdquo;&nbsp; Thence, having made this happy
impression, he explained how he had escaped, and thought better
of it, and at last concluded to come back, lay the truth before
the company, and take his chance with them once more: persuaded
as he was, they would instantly depose Harris and elect some
other leader.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is the whole truth,&rdquo; said
he: &ldquo;and with one exception, I put myself entirely in your
hands.&nbsp; What is the exception?&nbsp; There he sits,&rdquo;
he cried, pointing once more to Harris; &ldquo;a man that has to
die!&nbsp; Weapons and conditions are all one to me; put me face
to face with him, and if you give me nothing but a stick, in five
minutes I will show you a sop of broken carrion, fit for dogs to
roll in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was dark night when he made an end; they had listened in
almost perfect silence; but the firelight scarce permitted any
one to judge, from the look of his neighbours, with what result
of persuasion or conviction.&nbsp; Indeed, the Master had set
himself in the brightest place, and kept his face there, to be
the centre of men&rsquo;s eyes: doubtless on a profound
calculation.&nbsp; Silence followed for awhile, and presently the
whole party became involved in disputation: the Master lying on
his back, with his hands knit under his head and one knee flung
across the other, like a person unconcerned in the result.&nbsp;
And here, I daresay, his bravado carried him too far and
prejudiced his case.&nbsp; At least, after a cast or two back and
forward, opinion settled finally against him.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
possible he hoped to repeat the business of the pirate ship, and
be himself, perhaps, on hard enough conditions, elected leader;
and things went so far that way, that Mountain actually threw out
the proposition.&nbsp; But the rock he split upon was
Hastie.&nbsp; This fellow was not well liked, being sour and
slow, with an ugly, glowering disposition, but he had studied
some time for the church at Edinburgh College, before ill conduct
had destroyed his prospects, and he now remembered and applied
what he had learned.&nbsp; Indeed he had not proceeded very far,
when the Master rolled carelessly upon one side, which was done
(in Mountain&rsquo;s opinion) to conceal the beginnings of
despair upon his countenance.&nbsp; Hastie dismissed the most of
what they had heard as nothing to the matter: what they wanted
was the treasure.&nbsp; All that was said of Harris might be
true, and they would have to see to that in time.&nbsp; But what
had that to do with the treasure?&nbsp; They had heard a vast of
words; but the truth was just this, that Mr. Durie was damnably
frightened and had several times run off.&nbsp; Here he
was&mdash;whether caught or come back was all one to Hastie: the
point was to make an end of the business.&nbsp; As for the talk
of deposing and electing captains, he hoped they were all free
men and could attend their own affairs.&nbsp; That was dust flung
in their eyes, and so was the proposal to fight Harris.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He shall fight no one in this camp, I can tell him
that,&rdquo; said Hastie.&nbsp; &ldquo;We had trouble enough to
get his arms away from him, and we should look pretty fools to
give them back again.&nbsp; But if it&rsquo;s excitement the
gentleman is after, I can supply him with more than perhaps he
cares about.&nbsp; For I have no intention to spend the remainder
of my life in these mountains; already I have been too long; and
I propose that he should immediately tell us where that treasure
is, or else immediately be shot.&nbsp; And there,&rdquo; says he,
producing his weapon, &ldquo;there is the pistol that I mean to
use.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, I call you a man,&rdquo; cries the Master,
sitting up and looking at the speaker with an air of
admiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t ask you to call me anything,&rdquo;
returned Hastie; &ldquo;which is it to be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s an idle question,&rdquo; said the
Master.&nbsp; &ldquo;Needs must when the devil drives.&nbsp; The
truth is we are within easy walk of the place, and I will show it
you to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that, as if all were quite settled, and settled exactly
to his mind, he walked off to his tent, whither Secundra had
preceded him.</p>
<p>I cannot think of these last turns and wriggles of my old
enemy except with admiration; scarce even pity is mingled with
the sentiment, so strongly the man supported, so boldly resisted
his misfortunes.&nbsp; Even at that hour, when he perceived
himself quite lost, when he saw he had but effected an exchange
of enemies, and overthrown Harris to set Hastie up, no sign of
weakness appeared in his behaviour, and he withdrew to his tent,
already determined (I must suppose) upon affronting the
incredible hazard of his last expedient, with the same easy,
assured, genteel expression and demeanour as he might have left a
theatre withal to join a supper of the wits.&nbsp; But doubtless
within, if we could see there, his soul trembled.</p>
<p>Early in the night, word went about the camp that he was sick;
and the first thing the next morning he called Hastie to his
side, and inquired most anxiously if he had any skill in
medicine.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, this was a vanity of that
fallen divinity student&rsquo;s, to which he had cunningly
addressed himself.&nbsp; Hastie examined him; and being
flattered, ignorant, and highly auspicious, knew not in the least
whether the man was sick or malingering.&nbsp; In this state he
went forth again to his companions; and (as the thing which would
give himself most consequence either way) announced that the
patient was in a fair way to die.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For all that,&rdquo; he added with an oath, &ldquo;and
if he bursts by the wayside, he must bring us this morning to the
treasure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But there were several in the camp (Mountain among the number)
whom this brutality revolted.&nbsp; They would have seen the
Master pistolled, or pistolled him themselves, without the
smallest sentiment of pity; but they seemed to have been touched
by his gallant fight and unequivocal defeat the night before;
perhaps, too, they were even already beginning to oppose
themselves to their new leader: at least, they now declared that
(if the man was sick) he should have a day&rsquo;s rest in spite
of Hastie&rsquo;s teeth.</p>
<p>The next morning he was manifestly worse, and Hastie himself
began to display something of humane concern, so easily does even
the pretence of doctoring awaken sympathy.&nbsp; The third the
Master called Mountain and Hastie to the tent, announced himself
to be dying, gave them full particulars as to the position of the
cache, and begged them to set out incontinently on the quest, so
that they might see if he deceived them, and (if they were at
first unsuccessful) he should be able to correct their error.</p>
<p>But here arose a difficulty on which he doubtless
counted.&nbsp; None of these men would trust another, none would
consent to stay behind.&nbsp; On the other hand, although the
Master seemed extremely low, spoke scarce above a whisper, and
lay much of the time insensible, it was still possible it was a
fraudulent sickness; and if all went treasure-hunting, it might
prove they had gone upon a wild-goose chase, and return to find
their prisoner flown.&nbsp; They concluded, therefore, to hang
idling round the camp, alleging sympathy to their reason; and
certainly, so mingled are our dispositions, several were
sincerely (if not very deeply) affected by the natural peril of
the man whom they callously designed to murder.&nbsp; In the
afternoon, Hastie was called to the bedside to pray: the which
(incredible as it must appear) he did with unction; about eight
at night, the wailing of Secundra announced that all was over;
and before ten, the Indian, with a link stuck in the ground, was
toiling at the grave.&nbsp; Sunrise of next day beheld the
Master&rsquo;s burial, all hands attending with great decency of
demeanour; and the body was laid in the earth, wrapped in a fur
robe, with only the face uncovered; which last was of a waxy
whiteness, and had the nostrils plugged according to some
Oriental habit of Secundra&rsquo;s.&nbsp; No sooner was the grave
filled than the lamentations of the Indian once more struck
concern to every heart; and it appears this gang of murderers, so
far from resenting his outcries, although both distressful and
(in such a country) perilous to their own safety, roughly but
kindly endeavoured to console him.</p>
<p>But if human nature is even in the worst of men occasionally
kind, it is still, and before all things, greedy; and they soon
turned from the mourner to their own concerns.&nbsp; The cache of
the treasure being hard by, although yet unidentified, it was
concluded not to break camp; and the day passed, on the part of
the voyagers, in unavailing exploration of the woods, Secundra
the while lying on his master&rsquo;s grave.&nbsp; That night
they placed no sentinel, but lay altogether about the fire, in
the customary woodman fashion, the heads outward, like the spokes
of a wheel.&nbsp; Morning found them in the same disposition;
only Pinkerton, who lay on Mountain&rsquo;s right, between him
and Hastie, had (in the hours of darkness) been secretly
butchered, and there lay, still wrapped as to his body in his
mantle, but offering above that ungodly and horrific spectacle of
the scalped head.&nbsp; The gang were that morning as pale as a
company of phantoms, for the pertinacity of Indian war (or to
speak more correctly, Indian murder) was well known to all.&nbsp;
But they laid the chief blame on their unsentinelled posture; and
fired with the neighbourhood of the treasure, determined to
continue where they were.&nbsp; Pinkerton was buried hard by the
Master; the survivors again passed the day in exploration, and
returned in a mingled humour of anxiety and hope, being partly
certain they were now close on the discovery of what they sought,
and on the other hand (with the return of darkness) were infected
with the fear of Indians.&nbsp; Mountain was the first sentry; he
declares he neither slept nor yet sat down, but kept his watch
with a perpetual and straining vigilance, and it was even with
unconcern that (when he saw by the stars his time was up) he drew
near the fire to awaken his successor.&nbsp; This man (it was
Hicks the shoemaker) slept on the lee side of the circle,
something farther off in consequence than those to windward, and
in a place darkened by the blowing smoke.&nbsp; Mountain stooped
and took him by the shoulder; his hand was at once smeared by
some adhesive wetness; and (the wind at the moment veering) the
firelight shone upon the sleeper, and showed him, like Pinkerton,
dead and scalped.</p>
<p>It was clear they had fallen in the hands of one of those
matchless Indian bravos, that will sometimes follow a party for
days, and in spite of indefatigable travel, and unsleeping watch,
continue to keep up with their advance, and steal a scalp at
every resting-place.&nbsp; Upon this discovery, the
treasure-seekers, already reduced to a poor half dozen, fell into
mere dismay, seized a few necessaries, and deserting the
remainder of their goods, fled outright into the forest.&nbsp;
Their fire they left still burning, and their dead comrade
unburied.&nbsp; All day they ceased not to flee, eating by the
way, from hand to mouth; and since they feared to sleep,
continued to advance at random even in the hours of
darkness.&nbsp; But the limit of man&rsquo;s endurance is soon
reached; when they rested at last it was to sleep profoundly; and
when they woke, it was to find that the enemy was still upon
their heels, and death and mutilation had once more lessened and
deformed their company.</p>
<p>By this they had become light-headed, they had quite missed
their path in the wilderness, their stores were already running
low.&nbsp; With the further horrors, it is superfluous that I
should swell this narrative, already too prolonged.&nbsp; Suffice
it to say that when at length a night passed by innocuous, and
they might breathe again in the hope that the murderer had at
last desisted from pursuit, Mountain and Secundra were
alone.&nbsp; The trader is firmly persuaded their unseen enemy
was some warrior of his own acquaintance, and that he himself was
spared by favour.&nbsp; The mercy extended to Secundra he
explains on the ground that the East Indian was thought to be
insane; partly from the fact that, through all the horrors of the
flight and while others were casting away their very food and
weapons, Secundra continued to stagger forward with a mattock on
his shoulder, and partly because, in the last days and with a
great degree of heat and fluency, he perpetually spoke with
himself in his own language.&nbsp; But he was sane enough when it
came to English.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think he will be gone quite away?&rdquo; he asked,
upon their blest awakening in safety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I pray God so, I believe so, I dare to believe
so,&rdquo; Mountain had replied almost with incoherence, as he
described the scene to me.</p>
<p>And indeed he was so much distempered that until he met us,
the next morning, he could scarce be certain whether he had
dreamed, or whether it was a fact, that Secundra had thereupon
turned directly about and returned without a word upon their
footprints, setting his face for these wintry and hungry
solitudes, along a path whose every stage was mile-stoned with a
mutilated corpse.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XII.&mdash;THE JOURNEY IN THE WILDERNESS
(<i>continued</i>).</h2>
<p>Mountain&rsquo;s story, as it was laid before Sir William
Johnson and my lord, was shorn, of course, of all the earlier
particulars, and the expedition described to have proceeded
uneventfully, until the Master sickened.&nbsp; But the latter
part was very forcibly related, the speaker visibly thrilling to
his recollections; and our then situation, on the fringe of the
same desert, and the private interests of each, gave him an
audience prepared to share in his emotions.&nbsp; For
Mountain&rsquo;s intelligence not only changed the world for my
Lord Durrisdeer, but materially affected the designs of Sir
William Johnson.</p>
<p>These I find I must lay more at length before the
reader.&nbsp; Word had reached Albany of dubious import; it had
been rumoured some hostility was to be put in act; and the Indian
diplomatist had, thereupon, sped into the wilderness, even at the
approach of winter, to nip that mischief in the bud.&nbsp; Here,
on the borders, he learned that he was come too late; and a
difficult choice was thus presented to a man (upon the whole) not
any more bold than prudent.&nbsp; His standing with the painted
braves may be compared to that of my Lord President Culloden
among the chiefs of our own Highlanders at the &rsquo;forty-five;
that is as much as to say, he was, to these men, reason&rsquo;s
only speaking trumpet, and counsels of peace and moderation, if
they were to prevail at all, must prevail singly through his
influence.&nbsp; If, then, he should return, the province must
lie open to all the abominable tragedies of Indian war&mdash;the
houses blaze, the wayfarer be cut off, and the men of the woods
collect their usual disgusting spoil of human scalps.&nbsp; On
the other side, to go farther forth, to risk so small a party
deeper in the desert, to carry words of peace among warlike
savages already rejoicing to return to war: here was an extremity
from which it was easy to perceive his mind revolted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have come too late,&rdquo; he said more than once,
and would fall into a deep consideration, his head bowed in his
hands, his foot patting the ground.</p>
<p>At length he raised his face and looked upon us, that is to
say upon my lord, Mountain, and myself, sitting close round a
small fire, which had been made for privacy in one corner of the
camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My lord, to be quite frank with you, I find myself in
two minds,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think it very needful I
should go on, but not at all proper I should any longer enjoy the
pleasure of your company.&nbsp; We are here still upon the water
side; and I think the risk to southward no great matter.&nbsp;
Will not yourself and Mr. Mackellar take a single boat&rsquo;s
crew and return to Albany?&rdquo;</p>
<p>My lord, I should say, had listened to Mountain&rsquo;s
narrative, regarding him throughout with a painful intensity of
gaze; and since the tale concluded, had sat as in a dream.&nbsp;
There was something very daunting in his look; something to my
eyes not rightly human; the face, lean, and dark, and aged, the
mouth painful, the teeth disclosed in a perpetual rictus; the
eyeball swimming clear of the lids upon a field of blood-shot
white.&nbsp; I could not behold him myself without a jarring
irritation, such as, I believe, is too frequently the uppermost
feeling on the sickness of those dear to us.&nbsp; Others, I
could not but remark. were scarce able to support his
neighbourhood&mdash;Sir William eviting to be near him, Mountain
dodging his eye, and, when he met it, blenching and halting in
his story.&nbsp; At this appeal, however, my lord appeared to
recover his command upon himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To Albany?&rdquo; said he, with a good voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not short of it, at least,&rdquo; replied Sir
William.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is no safety nearer hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would be very sweir <a name="citation11"></a><a
href="#footnote11" class="citation">[11]</a> to return,&rdquo;
says my lord.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am not afraid&mdash;of
Indians,&rdquo; he added, with a jerk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish that I could say so much,&rdquo; returned Sir
William, smiling; &ldquo;although, if any man durst say it, it
should be myself.&nbsp; But you are to keep in view my
responsibility, and that as the voyage has now become highly
dangerous, and your business&mdash;if you ever had any,&rdquo;
says he, &ldquo;brought quite to a conclusion by the distressing
family intelligence you have received, I should be hardly
justified if I even suffered you to proceed, and run the risk of
some obloquy if anything regrettable should follow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My lord turned to Mountain.&nbsp; &ldquo;What did he pretend
he died of?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I understand your honour,&rdquo;
said the trader, pausing like a man very much affected, in the
dressing of some cruel frost-bites.</p>
<p>For a moment my lord seemed at a full stop; and then, with
some irritation, &ldquo;I ask you what he died of.&nbsp; Surely
that&rsquo;s a plain question,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Mountain.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Hastie even never knew.&nbsp; He seemed to sicken natural,
and just pass away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There it is, you see!&rdquo; concluded my lord, turning
to Sir William.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your lordship is too deep for me,&rdquo; replied Sir
William.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; says my lord, &ldquo;this in a matter of
succession; my son&rsquo;s title may be called in doubt; and the
man being supposed to be dead of nobody can tell what, a great
deal of suspicion would be naturally roused.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, God damn me, the man&rsquo;s buried!&rdquo; cried
Sir William.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will never believe that,&rdquo; returned my lord,
painfully trembling.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never believe
it!&rdquo; he cried again, and jumped to his feet.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Did he <i>look</i> dead?&rdquo; he asked of Mountain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look dead?&rdquo; repeated the trader.&nbsp; &ldquo;He
looked white.&nbsp; Why, what would he be at?&nbsp; I tell you, I
put the sods upon him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My lord caught Sir William by the coat with a hooked
hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;This man has the name of my brother,&rdquo;
says he, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s well understood that he was never
canny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Canny?&rdquo; says Sir William.&nbsp; &ldquo;What is
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not of this world,&rdquo; whispered my lord,
&ldquo;neither him nor the black deil that serves him.&nbsp; I
have struck my sword throughout his vitals,&rdquo; he cried;
&ldquo;I have felt the hilt dirl <a name="citation12"></a><a
href="#footnote12" class="citation">[12]</a> on his breastbone,
and the hot blood spirt in my very face, time and again, time and
again!&rdquo; he repeated, with a gesture indescribable.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But he was never dead for that,&rdquo; said he, and I
sighed aloud.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why should I think he was dead
now?&nbsp; No, not till I see him rotting,&rdquo; says he.</p>
<p>Sir William looked across at me with a long face.&nbsp;
Mountain forgot his wounds, staring and gaping.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I wish you would collect
your spirits.&rdquo;&nbsp; But my throat was so dry, and my own
wits so scattered, I could add no more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; says my lord, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not to be
supposed that he would understand me.&nbsp; Mackellar does, for
he kens all, and has seen him buried before now.&nbsp; This is a
very good servant to me, Sir William, this man Mackellar; he
buried him with his own hands&mdash;he and my father&mdash;by the
light of two siller candlesticks.&nbsp; The other man is a
familiar spirit; he brought him from Coromandel.&nbsp; I would
have told ye this long syne, Sir William, only it was in the
family.&rdquo;&nbsp; These last remarks he made with a kind of a
melancholy composure, and his time of aberration seemed to pass
away.&nbsp; &ldquo;You can ask yourself what it all means,&rdquo;
he proceeded.&nbsp; &ldquo;My brother falls sick, and dies, and
is buried, as so they say; and all seems very plain.&nbsp; But
why did the familiar go back?&nbsp; I think ye must see for
yourself it&rsquo;s a point that wants some clearing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will be at your service, my lord, in half a
minute,&rdquo; said Sir William, rising.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mr.
Mackellar, two words with you;&rdquo; and he led me without the
camp, the frost crunching in our steps, the trees standing at our
elbow, hoar with frost, even as on that night in the Long
Shrubbery.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of course, this is midsummer
madness,&rdquo; said Sir William, as soon as we were gotten out
of bearing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, certainly,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;The man is
mad.&nbsp; I think that manifest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I seize and bind him?&rdquo; asked Sir
William.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will upon your authority.&nbsp; If these
are all ravings, that should certainly be done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I looked down upon the ground, back at the camp, with its
bright fires and the folk watching us, and about me on the woods
and mountains; there was just the one way that I could not look,
and that was in Sir William&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir William,&rdquo; said I at last, &ldquo;I think my
lord not sane, and have long thought him so.&nbsp; But there are
degrees in madness; and whether he should be brought under
restraint&mdash;Sir William, I am no fit judge,&rdquo; I
concluded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will be the judge,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;I ask
for facts.&nbsp; Was there, in all that jargon, any word of truth
or sanity?&nbsp; Do you hesitate?&rdquo; he asked.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Am I to understand you have buried this gentleman
before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not buried,&rdquo; said I; and then, taking up courage
at last, &ldquo;Sir William,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;unless I were
to tell you a long story, which much concerns a noble family (and
myself not in the least), it would be impossible to make this
matter clear to you.&nbsp; Say the word, and I will do it, right
or wrong.&nbsp; And, at any rate, I will say so much, that my
lord is not so crazy as he seems.&nbsp; This is a strange matter,
into the tail of which you are unhappily drifted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I desire none of your secrets,&rdquo; replied Sir
William; &ldquo;but I will be plain, at the risk of incivility,
and confess that I take little pleasure in my present
company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would be the last to blame you,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not asked either for your censure or your
praise, sir,&rdquo; returned Sir William.&nbsp; &ldquo;I desire
simply to be quit of you; and to that effect, I put a boat and
complement of men at your disposal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is fairly offered,&rdquo; said I, after
reflection.&nbsp; &ldquo;But you must suffer me to say a word
upon the other side.&nbsp; We have a natural curiosity to learn
the truth of this affair; I have some of it myself; my lord (it
is very plain) has but too much.&nbsp; The matter of the
Indian&rsquo;s return is enigmatical.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so myself,&rdquo; Sir William interrupted,
&ldquo;and I propose (since I go in that direction) to probe it
to the bottom.&nbsp; Whether or not the man has gone like a dog
to die upon his master&rsquo;s grave, his life, at least, is in
great danger, and I propose, if I can, to save it.&nbsp; There is
nothing against his character?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing, Sir William,&rdquo; I replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the other?&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have
heard my lord, of course; but, from the circumstances of his
servant&rsquo;s loyalty, I must suppose he had some noble
qualities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must not ask me that!&rdquo; I cried.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Hell may have noble flames.&nbsp; I have known him a score
of years, and always hated, and always admired, and always
slavishly feared him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I appear to intrude again upon your secrets,&rdquo;
said Sir William, &ldquo;believe me, inadvertently.&nbsp; Enough
that I will see the grave, and (if possible) rescue the
Indian.&nbsp; Upon these terms, can you persuade your master to
return to Albany?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir William,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I will tell you how
it is.&nbsp; You do not see my lord to advantage; it will seem
even strange to you that I should love him; but I do, and I am
not alone.&nbsp; If he goes back to Albany, it must be by force,
and it will be the death-warrant of his reason, and perhaps his
life.&nbsp; That is my sincere belief; but I am in your hands,
and ready to obey, if you will assume so much responsibility as
to command.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will have no shred of responsibility; it is my single
endeavour to avoid the same,&rdquo; cried Sir William.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You insist upon following this journey up; and be it
so!&nbsp; I wash my hands of the whole matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With which word, he turned upon his heel and gave the order to
break camp; and my lord, who had been hovering near by, came
instantly to my side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which is it to be?&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are to have your way,&rdquo; I answered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You shall see the grave.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The situation of the Master&rsquo;s grave was, between guides,
easily described; it lay, indeed, beside a chief landmark of the
wilderness, a certain range of peaks, conspicuous by their design
and altitude, and the source of many brawling tributaries to that
inland sea, Lake Champlain.&nbsp; It was therefore possible to
strike for it direct, instead of following back the blood-stained
trail of the fugitives, and to cover, in some sixteen hours of
march, a distance which their perturbed wanderings had extended
over more than sixty.&nbsp; Our boats we left under a guard upon
the river; it was, indeed, probable we should return to find them
frozen fast; and the small equipment with which we set forth upon
the expedition, included not only an infinity of furs to protect
us from the cold, but an arsenal of snow-shoes to render travel
possible, when the inevitable snow should fall.&nbsp;
Considerable alarm was manifested at our departure; the march was
conducted with soldierly precaution, the camp at night sedulously
chosen and patrolled; and it was a consideration of this sort
that arrested us, the second day, within not many hundred yards
of our destination&mdash;the night being already imminent, the
spot in which we stood well qualified to be a strong camp for a
party of our numbers; and Sir William, therefore, on a sudden
thought, arresting our advance.</p>
<p>Before us was the high range of mountains toward which we had
been all day deviously drawing near.&nbsp; From the first light
of the dawn, their silver peaks had been the goal of our advance
across a tumbled lowland forest, thrid with rough streams, and
strewn with monstrous boulders; the peaks (as I say) silver, for
already at the higher altitudes the snow fell nightly; but the
woods and the low ground only breathed upon with frost.&nbsp; All
day heaven had been charged with ugly vapours, in the which the
sun swam and glimmered like a shilling piece; all day the wind
blew on our left cheek barbarous cold, but very pure to
breathe.&nbsp; With the end of the afternoon, however, the wind
fell; the clouds, being no longer reinforced, were scattered or
drunk up; the sun set behind us with some wintry splendour, and
the white brow of the mountains shared its dying glow.</p>
<p>It was dark ere we had supper; we ate in silence, and the meal
was scarce despatched before my lord slunk from the fireside to
the margin of the camp; whither I made haste to follow him.&nbsp;
The camp was on high ground, overlooking a frozen lake, perhaps a
mile in its longest measurement; all about us, the forest lay in
heights and hollows; above rose the white mountains; and higher
yet, the moon rode in a fair sky.&nbsp; There was no breath of
air; nowhere a twig creaked; and the sounds of our own camp were
hushed and swallowed up in the surrounding stillness.&nbsp; Now
that the sun and the wind were both gone down, it appeared almost
warm, like a night of July: a singular illusion of the sense,
when earth, air, and water were strained to bursting with the
extremity of frost.</p>
<p>My lord (or what I still continued to call by his loved name)
stood with his elbow in one hand, and his chin sunk in the other,
gazing before him on the surface of the wood.&nbsp; My eyes
followed his, and rested almost pleasantly upon the frosted
contexture of the pines, rising in moonlit hillocks, or sinking
in the shadow of small glens.&nbsp; Hard by, I told myself, was
the grave of our enemy, now gone where the wicked cease from
troubling, the earth heaped for ever on his once so active
limbs.&nbsp; I could not but think of him as somehow fortunate to
be thus done with man&rsquo;s anxiety and weariness, the daily
expense of spirit, and that daily river of circumstance to be
swum through, at any hazard, under the penalty of shame or
death.&nbsp; I could not but think how good was the end of that
long travel; and with that, my mind swung at a tangent to my
lord.&nbsp; For was not my lord dead also? a maimed soldier,
looking vainly for discharge, lingering derided in the line of
battle?&nbsp; A kind man, I remembered him; wise, with a decent
pride, a son perhaps too dutiful, a husband only too loving, one
that could suffer and be silent, one whose hand I loved to
press.&nbsp; Of a sudden, pity caught in my windpipe with a sob;
I could have wept aloud to remember and behold him; and standing
thus by his elbow, under the broad moon, I prayed fervently
either that he should be released, or I strengthened to persist
in my affection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh God,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;this was the best man to
me and to himself, and now I shrink from him.&nbsp; He did no
wrong, or not till he was broke with sorrows; these are but his
honourable wounds that we begin to shrink from.&nbsp; Oh, cover
them up, oh, take him away, before we hate him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was still so engaged in my own bosom, when a sound broke
suddenly upon the night.&nbsp; It was neither very loud, nor very
near; yet, bursting as it did from so profound and so prolonged a
silence, it startled the camp like an alarm of trumpets.&nbsp;
Ere I had taken breath, Sir William was beside me, the main part
of the voyagers clustered at his back, intently giving ear.&nbsp;
Methought, as I glanced at them across my shoulder, there was a
whiteness, other than moonlight, on their cheeks; and the rays of
the moon reflected with a sparkle on the eyes of some, and the
shadows lying black under the brows of others (according as they
raised or bowed the head to listen) gave to the group a strange
air of animation and anxiety.&nbsp; My lord was to the front,
crouching a little forth, his hand raised as for silence: a man
turned to stone.&nbsp; And still the sounds continued,
breathlessly renewed with a precipitate rhythm.</p>
<p>Suddenly Mountain spoke in a loud, broken whisper, as of a man
relieved.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have it now,&rdquo; he said; and, as we
all turned to hear him, &ldquo;the Indian must have known the
cache,&rdquo; he added.&nbsp; &ldquo;That is he&mdash;he is
digging out the treasure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, to be sure!&rdquo; exclaimed Sir William.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We were geese not to have supposed so much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The only thing is,&rdquo; Mountain resumed, &ldquo;the
sound is very close to our old camp.&nbsp; And, again, I do not
see how he is there before us, unless the man had
wings!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Greed and fear are wings,&rdquo; remarked Sir
William.&nbsp; &ldquo;But this rogue has given us an alert, and I
have a notion to return the compliment.&nbsp; What say you,
gentlemen, shall we have a moonlight hunt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was so agreed; dispositions were made to surround Secundra
at his task; some of Sir William&rsquo;s Indians hastened in
advance; and a strong guard being left at our headquarters, we
set forth along the uneven bottom of the forest; frost crackling,
ice sometimes loudly splitting under foot; and overhead the
blackness of pine-woods, and the broken brightness of the
moon.&nbsp; Our way led down into a hollow of the land; and as we
descended, the sounds diminished and had almost died away.&nbsp;
Upon the other slope it was more open, only dotted with a few
pines, and several vast and scattered rocks that made inky
shadows in the moonlight.&nbsp; Here the sounds began to reach us
more distinctly; we could now perceive the ring of iron, and more
exactly estimate the furious degree of haste with which the
digger plied his instrument.&nbsp; As we neared the top of the
ascent, a bird or two winged aloft and hovered darkly in the
moonlight; and the next moment we were gazing through a fringe of
trees upon a singular picture.</p>
<p>A narrow plateau, overlooked by the white mountains, and
encompassed nearer hand by woods, lay bare to the strong radiance
of the moon.&nbsp; Rough goods, such as make the wealth of
foresters, were sprinkled here and there upon the ground in
meaningless disarray.&nbsp; About the midst, a tent stood,
silvered with frost: the door open, gaping on the black
interior.&nbsp; At the one end of this small stage lay what
seemed the tattered remnants of a man.&nbsp; Without doubt we had
arrived upon the scene of Harris&rsquo;s encampment; there were
the goods scattered in the panic of flight; it was in yon tent
the Master breathed his last; and the frozen carrion that lay
before us was the body of the drunken shoemaker.&nbsp; It was
always moving to come upon the theatre of any tragic incident; to
come upon it after so many days, and to find it (in the seclusion
of a desert) still unchanged, must have impressed the mind of the
most careless.&nbsp; And yet it was not that which struck us into
pillars of stone; but the sight (which yet we had been half
expecting) of Secundra ankle deep in the grave of his late
master.&nbsp; He had cast the main part of his raiment by, yet
his frail arms and shoulders glistered in the moonlight with a
copious sweat; his face was contracted with anxiety and
expectation; his blows resounded on the grave, as thick as sobs;
and behind him, strangely deformed and ink-black upon the frosty
ground, the creature&rsquo;s shadow repeated and parodied his
swift gesticulations.&nbsp; Some night birds arose from the
boughs upon our coming, and then settled back; but Secundra,
absorbed in his toil; heard or heeded not at all.</p>
<p>I heard Mountain whisper to Sir William, &ldquo;Good God!
it&rsquo;s the grave!&nbsp; He&rsquo;s digging him
up!&rdquo;&nbsp; It was what we had all guessed, and yet to hear
it put in language thrilled me.&nbsp; Sir William violently
started.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You damned sacrilegious hound!&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Secundra leaped in the air, a little breathless cry escaped
him, the tool flew from his grasp, and he stood one instant
staring at the speaker.&nbsp; The next, swift as an arrow, he
sped for the woods upon the farther side; and the next again,
throwing up his hands with a violent gesture of resolution, he
had begun already to retrace his steps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, you come, you help&mdash;&rdquo; he was
saying.&nbsp; But by now my lord had stepped beside Sir William;
the moon shone fair upon his face, and the words were still upon
Secundra&rsquo;s lips, when he beheld and recognised his
master&rsquo;s enemy.&nbsp; &ldquo;Him!&rdquo; he screamed,
clasping his hands, and shrinking on himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, come!&rdquo; said Sir William.&nbsp; &ldquo;There
is none here to do you harm, if you be innocent; and if you be
guilty, your escape is quite cut off.&nbsp; Speak, what do you
here among the graves of the dead and the remains of the
unburied?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You no murderer?&rdquo; inquired Secundra.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You true man? you see me safe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will see you safe, if you be innocent,&rdquo;
returned Sir William.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have said the thing, and I
see not wherefore you should doubt it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There all murderers,&rdquo; cried Secundra, &ldquo;that
is why!&nbsp; He kill&mdash;murderer,&rdquo; pointing to
Mountain; &ldquo;there two hire-murderers,&rdquo; pointing to my
lord and myself&mdash;&ldquo;all gallows&mdash;murderers!&nbsp;
Ah! I see you all swing in a rope.&nbsp; Now I go save the sahib;
he see you swing in a rope.&nbsp; The sahib,&rdquo; he continued,
pointing to the grave, &ldquo;he not dead.&nbsp; He bury, he not
dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My lord uttered a little noise, moved nearer to the grave, and
stood and stared in it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Buried and not dead?&rdquo; exclaimed Sir
William.&nbsp; &ldquo;What kind of rant is this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See, sahib,&rdquo; said Secundra.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
sahib and I alone with murderers; try all way to escape, no way
good.&nbsp; Then try this way: good way in warm climate, good way
in India; here, in this dam cold place, who can tell?&nbsp; I
tell you pretty good hurry: you help, you light a fire, help
rub.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the creature talking of?&rdquo; cried Sir
William.&nbsp; &ldquo;My head goes round.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you I bury him alive,&rdquo; said Secundra.
&ldquo;I teach him swallow his tongue.&nbsp; Now dig him up
pretty good hurry, and he not much worse.&nbsp; You light a
fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir William turned to the nearest of his men.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Light a fire,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;My lot seems to
be cast with the insane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You good man,&rdquo; returned Secundra.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Now I go dig the sahib up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He returned as he spoke to the grave, and resumed his former
toil.&nbsp; My lord stood rooted, and I at my lord&rsquo;s side,
fearing I knew not what.</p>
<p>The frost was not yet very deep, and presently the Indian
threw aside his tool, and began to scoop the dirt by
handfuls.&nbsp; Then he disengaged a corner of a buffalo robe;
and then I saw hair catch among his fingers: yet, a moment more,
and the moon shone on something white.&nbsp; Awhile Secundra
crouched upon his knees, scraping with delicate fingers,
breathing with puffed lips; and when he moved aside, I beheld the
face of the Master wholly disengaged.&nbsp; It was deadly white,
the eyes closed, the ears and nostrils plugged, the cheeks
fallen, the nose sharp as if in death; but for all he had lain so
many days under the sod, corruption had not approached him, and
(what strangely affected all of us) his lips and chin were
mantled with a swarthy beard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God!&rdquo; cried Mountain, &ldquo;he was as smooth
as a baby when we laid him there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They say hair grows upon the dead,&rdquo; observed Sir
William; but his voice was thick and weak.</p>
<p>Secundra paid no heed to our remarks, digging swift as a
terrier in the loose earth.&nbsp; Every moment the form of the
Master, swathed in his buffalo robe, grew more distinct in the
bottom of that shallow trough; the moon shining strong, and the
shadows of the standers-by, as they drew forward and back,
falling and flitting over his emergent countenance.&nbsp; The
sight held us with a horror not before experienced.&nbsp; I dared
not look my lord in the face; but for as long as it lasted, I
never observed him to draw breath; and a little in the background
one of the men (I know not whom) burst into a kind of
sobbing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Secundra, &ldquo;you help me lift him
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of the flight of time, I have no idea; it may have been three
hours, and it may have been five, that the Indian laboured to
reanimate his master&rsquo;s body.&nbsp; One thing only I know,
that it was still night, and the moon was not yet set, although
it had sunk low, and now barred the plateau with long shadows,
when Secundra uttered a small cry of satisfaction; and, leaning
swiftly forth, I thought I could myself perceive a change upon
that icy countenance of the unburied.&nbsp; The next moment I
beheld his eyelids flutter; the next they rose entirely, and the
week-old corpse looked me for a moment in the face.</p>
<p>So much display of life I can myself swear to.&nbsp; I have
heard from others that he visibly strove to speak, that his teeth
showed in his beard, and that his brow was contorted as with an
agony of pain and effort.&nbsp; And this may have been; I know
not, I was otherwise engaged.&nbsp; For at that first disclosure
of the dead man&rsquo;s eyes, my Lord Durrisdeer fell to the
ground, and when I raised him up, he was a corpse.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Day came, and still Secundra could not be persuaded to desist
from his unavailing efforts.&nbsp; Sir William, leaving a small
party under my command, proceeded on his embassy with the first
light; and still the Indian rubbed the limbs and breathed in the
mouth of the dead body.&nbsp; You would think such labours might
have vitalised a stone; but, except for that one moment (which
was my lord&rsquo;s death), the black spirit of the Master held
aloof from its discarded clay; and by about the hour of noon,
even the faithful servant was at length convinced.&nbsp; He took
it with unshaken quietude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too cold,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;good way in India, no
good here.&rdquo;&nbsp; And, asking for some food, which he
ravenously devoured as soon as it was set before him, he drew
near to the fire and took his place at my elbow.&nbsp; In the
same spot, as soon as he had eaten, he stretched himself out, and
fell into a childlike slumber, from which I must arouse him, some
hours afterwards, to take his part as one of the mourners at the
double funeral.&nbsp; It was the same throughout; he seemed to
have outlived at once and with the same effort, his grief for his
master and his terror of myself and Mountain.</p>
<p>One of the men left with me was skilled in stone-cutting; and
before Sir William returned to pick us up, I had chiselled on a
boulder this inscription, with a copy of which I may fitly bring
my narrative to a close:##</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any

distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
